Safety and Efficacy of Different Therapeutic Interventions on Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness. COVID-19 has now become a global public health crisis causing alarming numbers of morbidity and mortality. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started scientists, researchers, universities, companies, and institutions all around the world have been endeavoring to discover a potential treatment for COVID-19. Numerous studies and clinical trials on vaccines and drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are underway across the world. However, the uncertainty around the efficacy and safety of various treatment regimens have become one of the biggest challenges in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2. This paper is a narrative review of articles regarding the various treatments and vaccines being tested for the SARS-CoV-2, available in the PubMed database along with Google Scholar. There are ongoing clinical trials on potential drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids tocilizumab, azithromycin, anakinra, etc. and other therapeutic modalities like convalescent plasma therapy. Likewise, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being developed and tested, including mRNA, non-replicating viral vector, DNA, protein subunit candidate vaccines, etc. Although some early-stage clinical trials and studies on these drugs and vaccines have shown positive results, definitive and conclusive results are yet to be obtained. Keywords: COVID-19; antiviral drugs; COVID-19 treatment; COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2."
Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Chest CT with RT-PCR in Suspected Coronavirus Patients in Bangladesh.,"A cross sectional study was conducted to demonstrate the value of Computed Tomographic (CT) scan in clinically suspected 114 COVID-19 patients with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings of chest CT. The CT findings were compared and correlated with the results of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for corona virus disease. This study was conducted in the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka with clinically COVID-19 suspected patients. This cross sectional study was performed from July 7 to August 7, 2020 where both chest HRCT and RT-PCR test were included, keeping RT-PCR as the reference standard. Of the 114 patients 104(91.22%) patients had ground glass opacities (with no consolidation), 50(43.85%) patients had ground glass opacity and consolidation. Along with ground glass opacities 60(52.63%) patients had associated crazy paving appearance, 44(39.59%) patients had reverse halo sign, 76(66.66%) patients had vascular thickening and 60(52.63%) patients had fibrotic shadows. Most patients (94%) (98/104) had bilateral chest CT findings. Out of 114 patients, 96 (84%) patients had positive RT-PCR results and 18(15.7%) patients had negative RT-PCR results. Out of 96 RT-PCR positive patients, 90 patients had positive chest CT findings, where was 06 patients had negative CT findings. On the other hand, out of 18 RT-PCR negative patients, 14 patients had positive chest CT findings while 4 patients had negative chest CT findings. To conclude, chest CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, Data and analysis from our study suggests that chest CT ought to be considered for the COVID-19 as a primary diagnostic tool for early detection of COVID-19 patients where awaited RT-PCR results."
Dynamic Chest CT Evaluation in Three Cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia.,"A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There have been some reports of imaging findings regarding the disease's characteristic features. Here, we report three cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dynamic pulmonary CT evaluation. The CT scan showed multiple regions of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in COVID-19 patients and the CT scan was useful in tracking the progression or regression of COVID-19."
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S Protein Binds to Glycans of the Lactosamine Family in vitro.,"Many viruses, beside binding to their main cell target, interact with other molecules that promote virus adhesion to the cell; often, these additional targets are glycans. The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is a peptide motif in the ACE2 protein. We studied interaction of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with an array of glycoconjugates, including various sialylated, sulfated, and other glycans, and found that the S protein binds some (but not all) glycans of the lactosamine family. We suggest that parallel influenza infection will promote SARS-CoV-2 adhesion to the respiratory epithelial cells due to the unmasking of lactosamine chains by the influenza virus neuraminidase."
Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality.,"SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibody therapies, including COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), monoclonal antibodies, and hyperimmune globulin, are among the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies against CoV2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a 2-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting desired therapeutics and understanding the complex immune responses elicited by CoV2 infection."
"Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility - King County, Washington, March 2020.","Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4)."
A COVID-19 testing and triage algorithm for psychiatric units: One hospital's response to the New York region's pandemic.,"Psychiatric patients are at high risk for contracting COVID-19, and inpatient psychiatric units face substantial risks of institutional outbreaks. Here, the authors describe an algorithm for testing and triage in a large psychiatric facility designed to prevent local COVID-19 transmission. The algorithm is based on expert opinion and clinical experience between March and April of 2020, during which the institution cared for 47 COVID-19 positive psychiatric inpatients. The implementation of the algorithm is designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, preserve the safest and least restrictive treatment environment for psychiatric inpatients, and provide a model adaptable to other institutional settings."
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection-Induced Chilblains: A Brisk Perieccrine Inflammatory Response.,"The varying cutaneous and pathological manifestations of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) may have prognostic implications. Acral ischemic findings present with a hypercoagulable state in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test). We continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and quarantining to prevent spread to the older and immunocompromised patients."
Utilization and Results of Repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing in a Presumptive Low Prevalence Population.,"Introduction: Early reports have raised concerns regarding the clinical sensitivity of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for patients with COVID-19 symptoms, which has led to requests for repeat testing at our institution. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice. Methods: The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed. Results: Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%. Conclusion: In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases."
In the long shadow of our best intentions: Model-based assessment of the consequences of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake."
Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients in Turkey reveals the presence of novel mutations in spike and nsp12 proteins.,"Novel mutations have been emerging in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); consequently, the evolving of more virulent and treatment resistance strains have the potential to increase transmissibility and mortality rates. The characterization of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes is critical for understanding the origin and transmission pathways of the virus, as well as identifying mutations that affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus. We present an analysis of the mutation pattern and clade distribution of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained from specimens tested at Gazi University Medical Virology Laboratory. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens. Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on Illumina iSeq 100 platform. Raw sequencing data were processed to obtain full-length genome sequences and variant calling was performed to analyze amino acid changes. Clade distribution was determined to understand the phylogenetic background in relation to global data. A total of 293 distinct mutations were identified, of which 152 missense, 124 synonymous, 12 noncoding, and 5 deletions. The most frequent mutations were P323L (nsp12), D614G (ORF2/S), and 2421C>T (5'-untranslated region) found simultaneously in all sequences. Novel mutations were found in nsp12 (V111A, H133R, Y453C, M626K) and ORF2/S (R995G, V1068L). Nine different Pangolin lineages were detected. The most frequently assigned lineage was B.1.1 (17 sequences), followed by B.1 (7 sequences) and B.1.1.36 (3 sequences). Sequence information is essential for revealing genomic diversity. Mutations might have significant functional implications and analysis of these mutations provides valuable information for therapeutic and vaccine development studies. Our findings point to the introduction of the virus into Turkey through various sources and the subsequent spread of several key variants."
Efforts towards a COVID-19 vaccine.,"To many scientists and political authorities, the development of a vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the way to restore normality to civil life in this time of a devastating pandemic. Expectations for a vaccine are high while the case numbers continue to rise. As of mid-August 2020, more than 20 million people have been infected and more than 760 000 lives have been lost worldwide. The threat of this virus to health, the economy and to society is so great that the wish for a fast track vaccine is understandable, but how realistic is it? This survey article tries to give an overview of vaccine candidates in development, including preclinical and clinical testing, and it mentions some of the societal problems of vaccine acceptance."
Impact of Pool Testing in Detection of Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19.,"Objective: During the current pandemic, COVID-19 has been detected in patients using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The demand for increased testing, particularly for asymptomatic individuals required alternative approaches to single-patient RT-PCR testing, such as pooling. Methods: This study explored the impact of dilution on the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients using RT-PCR and demonstrated that pooling can be effective in low prevalence populations. Results: The RT-PCR results for the 3:1, 5:1, and 7:1 aliquot samples showed little differences in CT values, confirming detection capability at these dilutions. Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, a pooled approach with up to 5:1 sample aliquots and using the current RT-PCR methodology likely will detect SARS CoV2 RNA among asymptomatic patients."
Comparison of Symptoms and RNA Levels in Children and Adults With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Community Setting.,"Importance: The association between COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in children living in the community is not well understood. Objective: To characterize symptoms of pediatric COVID-19 in the community and analyze the association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as approximated by cycle threshold (Ct) values, in children and adults. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020. A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included. Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples. Main outcomes and measures: RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms. Results: Among 555 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, -3.0; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P = .02; adjusted estimate for adults, -2.9; 95% CI, -5.2 to -0.6; P = .01). The difference in mean Ct values was neither statistically significant between symptomatic children and symptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.7; 95% CI, -2.2 to 0.9; P = .41) nor between asymptomatic children and asymptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.6; 95% CI, -4.0 to 2.8; P = .74). Conclusions and relevance: In this community-based cross-sectional study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as determined by Ct values, were significantly higher in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic individuals and no significant age-related differences were found. Further research is needed to understand the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and viral transmission."
Landscape and progress of global COVID-19 vaccine development.,"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected billions of lives globally, and the world hopes to end this epidemic by effective vaccination. In this review, we depict the latest panorama of global COVID-19 vaccine research and development based on different technology platforms, and summarize key characteristics and available evidence on vaccines authorized for emergency use, in order to provide insights into improve coordination in the COVID-19 outbreak response for related stakeholders."
Positive aspects of the mRNA platform for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"The unprecedented need to acquire a safe and effective vaccine for the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global imperative. Researchers have been working urgently and collaboratively to develop vaccines against the causative agent of COVID-19. The use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform offers new opportunities for the development of effective vaccines. The first use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for individuals outside the clinical trials raised concerns over their safety and future efficacy. In social media, particularly in developing countries, widely shared false claims allege that the current mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines potentially integrate into the host genome and thus may genetically modify humans. These vaccines are also assumed to lack efficacy due to the emergence of new strains. Such misinformation cause people to hesitate about receiving vaccination against COVID-19. This commentary aimed to outline the structure, mechanism of action and the major motive for the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with a focus on scientifically addressing challenges associated with conspiracy theories and dispelling misinformation around vaccination."
Could BCG Vaccination Induce Protective Trained Immunity for SARS-CoV-2?,"Trained immunity is a type of non-specific memory-like immune response induced by some pathogens and vaccines, such as BCG, which can confer antigen-independent protection against a wide variety of pathogens. The BCG vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2."
Infrared Based Saliva Screening Test for COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID-19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose-built transflection accessory for rapid point-of-care detection of COVID-19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM-IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93 % (27/29) with a specificity of 82 % (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT-qPCR. Herein, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept high throughput infrared COVID-19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self-collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening."
Potential interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with human cell receptors in the skin: Understanding the enigma for a lower frequency of skin lesions compared to other tissues.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a new public health problem, with a total of 10.577.263 documented COVID-19 cases worldwide and 513.441 deaths up to the present date. Few cases of disease-related cutaneous manifestations have been reported in the literature, and such manifestations are scarce. Integumentary manifestations from COVID-19 include exanthemas and papular dermatoses, urticarial eruptions, atopic dermatitis, vesiculobullous lesions and skin signs of hypercoagulable states, such as acral ischaemia, livedo and retiform purpura. Most common extracutaneous manifestations from the disease include headache, cough, anosmia, ageusia, fever, dyspnoea, nausea, diarrhoea and cardiovascular events. The objectives of this review were to discuss the role of human cell receptors described as interaction targets of SARS-CoV-2, as well to understand the current state of knowledge on skin expression of these receptors, in order to substantiate future research. The authors present a thorough literature review on SARS-CoV-2 and its possible interaction with cell receptors and human tissues including the skin. They discuss a molecular hypothesis to explain the lower prevalence of dermatological manifestations from direct SARS-CoV-2 infection. Distinct human cell receptors binding the virus appear to be less expressed in the skin compared to other organs. Additionally, the presence of resolvins and the disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM17 provide a putative protection to the skin, explaining the majority of COVID-19 manifestations to be extracutaneous. This review represents an excellent opportunity for future studies using skin biopsies from COVID-19 patients to investigate molecular expression in the pathophysiology of cutaneous manifestations of the disease."
The Contribution of Endothelial Dysfunction in Systemic Injury Subsequent to SARS-Cov-2 Infection.,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection is associated, alongside with lung infection and respiratory disease, to cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs at any stage of the disease. This includes ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. Thus, early alteration of the functionality of endothelial cells, which may be found soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, seems to represent the major target of a SARS CoV-2 disease state and accounts for the systemic vascular dysfunction that leads to a detrimental effect in terms of hospitalization and death accompanying the disease. In particular, the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located in the endothelial cell surface, either at the pulmonary and systemic level, leads to early impairment of endothelial function, which, in turn, is followed by vascular inflammation and thrombosis of peripheral blood vessels. This highlights systemic hypoxia and further aggravates the vicious circle that compromises the development of the disease, leading to irreversible tissue damage and death of people with SARS CoV-2 infection. The review aims to assess some recent advances to define the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular complications accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the molecular mechanisms associated with the interaction of SARS CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located on the endothelial cells are highlighted to support its role in compromising endothelial cell functionality. Finally, the consequences of endothelial dysfunction in enhancing pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are assessed in order to identify early therapeutic interventions able to reduce the impact of the disease in high-risk patients."
A case of thrombocytopenia and multiple thromboses after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against SARS-CoV-2.,"Recently, reports of severe thromboses, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage in persons vaccinated with the chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AZD1222, Vaxzevria; Oxford/AstraZeneca) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have emerged. We describe an otherwise healthy 30-year-old woman who developed thrombocytopenia, ecchymosis, portal vein thrombosis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis the second week after she received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Extensive diagnostic workup for thrombosis predispositions showed heterozygosity for the prothrombin mutation, but no evidence of myeloproliferative neoplasia or infectious or autoimmune diseases. Her only temporary risk factor was long-term use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Although both the prothrombin mutation and use of OCPs predispose to portal and cerebral vein thrombosis, the occurrence of multiple thromboses within a short time and the associated pattern of thrombocytopenia and consumption coagulopathy are highly unusual. A maximum 4T heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) score and a positive immunoassay for anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies identified autoimmune HIT as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Although causality has not been established, our case emphasizes the importance of clinical awareness. Further studies of this potentially new clinical entity have suggested that it should be regarded as a vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia."
Optimal allocation of limited vaccine to minimize the effective reproduction number.,"We examine the problem of allocating a limited supply of vaccine for controlling an infectious disease with the goal of minimizing the effective reproduction number Re. We consider an SIR model with two interacting populations and develop an analytical expression that the optimal vaccine allocation must satisfy. With limited vaccine supplies, we find that an all-or-nothing approach is optimal. For certain special cases, we determine the conditions under which the optimal Re is below 1. We present an example of vaccine allocation for COVID-19 and show that it is optimal to vaccinate younger individuals before older individuals to minimize Re if less than 59% of the population can be vaccinated. The analytical conditions we develop provide a simple means of determining the optimal allocation of vaccine between two population groups to minimize Re."
"COVID-19 Co-infection with Legionella pneumophila in 2 Tertiary-Care Hospitals, Germany.","We describe screening results for detection of co-infections with Legionella pneumophila in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In total, 93 patients were tested; 1 was positive (1.1%) for L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Co-infections with L. pneumophila occur in coronavirus disease patients and should not be missed."
[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery and organ transplantation].,"Background and objective: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic extensive reorganization and limitation of resources within the healthcare system became inevitable. This review highlights the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fields of hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery and organ transplantation incorporating the current literature and expert opinions published by national and international societies. Trends in surgical numbers were analyzed via the Eurotransplant Statistics Report Library and an in-center evaluation of HPB surgical procedures. Results: For the fields of HPB surgery and organ transplantation a drastic decrease of procedures performed during the first wave of the pandemic was broadly reported. Interestingly, a compensatory increase of procedures was mostly not observed during the following months resulting in a slight overall decrease for 2020 compared to 2019. Whether this trend was due to increased mortality because of postponed surgeries and altered treatment regimens cannot be ruled out at this time. A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is definitely associated with a complicated course, especially in the perioperative course and after transplantation. Discussion: Due to the increased risk profile of the named patient groups, there is an increased risk for a severe COVID-19 course. This must be considered when weighing up the treatment alternatives, protection recommendations and prioritization for vaccinations."
The Usefulness of the Test-Positive Proportion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 as a Surveillance Tool.,"Comparison of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virological testing to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test-positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to inform trends in incidence. We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19-like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19-like symptoms encodes information similar to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states might have higher or lower TPP than average. Collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times."
"Nanomedicine as a promising approach for diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis against COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) puts the world in an unprecedented crisis, leaving behind huge human losses and deep socioeconomic damages. Due to the lack of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2, effective vaccines and antiviral agents are urgently needed to properly restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Repositioned drugs such as remdesivir have revealed a promising clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Interestingly, nanomedicine as a promising therapeutic approach could effectively help win the battle between coronaviruses (CoVs) and host cells. This review discusses the potential therapeutic approaches, in addition to the contribution of nanomedicine against CoVs in the fields of vaccination, diagnosis and therapy."
An in silico deep learning approach to multi-epitope vaccine design: a SARS-CoV-2 case study.,"The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world. Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus."
The effect of spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.,"Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines show protective efficacy, which is most likely mediated by neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral entry protein, spike. Because new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging rapidly, as exemplified by the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand whether antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or current vaccines remain effective. In this study, we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated spike pseudotypes based on divergence from SARS-CoV and then compare neutralization of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotype and individual mutations. Spike-specific monoclonal antibody neutralization is reduced dramatically; in contrast, polyclonal antibodies from individuals infected in early 2020 remain active against most mutated spike pseudotypes, but potency is reduced in a minority of samples. This work highlights that changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their effect on vaccine efficacy."
Amantadine in the prevention of clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Amantadine is a drug that can help in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology, as has been demonstrated in observational clinical studies. Methods: We searched in the PubMed database Clinical Studies of coronavirus-infected patients who have been treated with amantadine in a preventive manner as well as patients with Parkinson's disease. Results: Four clinical studies were found in which relatives of patients with COVID-19 had been prescribed the use of amantadine in a preventive manner to avoid the symptoms caused by the coronavirus. Conclusion: Amantadine is a drug that can be prescribed as a prophylactic that prevents symptomatology caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus."
Free SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Particles May Play a Role in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 Infection.,"The imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system is currently considered as a potentially important factor of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. It has been shown previously in the murine model, that the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is downregulated in response to the infection by SARS-CoV virus or recombinant spike protein (S protein) alone. In the case of natural infection, circulation of the S protein in a soluble form is unlikely. However, in SARS-CoV-2, a large fraction of S protein trimers is pre-processed during virion morphogenesis due to the presence of furin protease cleavage site between the S1 and S2 subunits. Therefore, S protein transition into the fusion conformation may be accompanied by the separation of the S1 subunits carrying the receptor-binding domains from the membrane-bound S2 subunits. The fate of the S1 particles shed due to the spontaneous ""firing"" of some S protein trimers exposed on the virions and on the surface of infected cells has been never investigated. We hypothesize that the soluble S1 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shed from the infected cells and from the virions in vivo may bind to the ACE2 and downregulate cell surface expression of this protein. The decrease in the ACE2 activity on the background of constant or increased ACE activity in the lungs may lead to the prevalence of angiotensin II effects over those of angiotensin (1-7), thus promoting thrombosis, inflammation, and pulmonary damage. This hypothesis also suggests the association between less pronounced shedding of the S1 particles reported for the S protein carrying the D614G mutation (vs. the wild type D614 protein), and lack of increased severity of the COVID-19 infection caused by the mutant (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 strain, despite its higher infectivity and higher in vivo viral load."
A follow-up study shows that recovered patients with re-positive PCR test in Wuhan may not be infectious.,"Background: Previous studies showed that recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can have a subsequent positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after they are discharged from the hospital. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients who have a re-positive test is vital for preventing a second wave of COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of 20,280 COVID-19 patients from multiple centers in Wuhan who had a positive PCR test between December 31, 2019, and August 4, 2020. The RT-PCR test results for 4079 individuals who had close contact with the re-positive cases were also obtained. Results: In total, 2466 (12.16%) of the 20,280 patients had a re-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after they were discharged from the hospital, and 4079 individuals had close contact with members of this patient group. All of these 4079 individuals had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Conclusions: This retrospective study in Wuhan analyzed the basic characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients with re-positive PCR test and found that these cases may not be infectious."
Promoting access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma in low- and middle-income countries.,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain neglected in the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (i.e. plasma collected from individuals after their recovery from COVID-19) has emerged as a leading medical treatment for COVID-19. Studies to date support the safety-and increasingly the efficacy-of CCP to treat COVID-19. This has motivated large-scale procurement and transfusion of CCP, notably in the United States (US), where inventories of CCP have been attained, and government-supported stockpiling of CCP is underway. CCP is a therapy that could be implemented in LMICs. However, systemic and transfusion-specific challenges (e.g. capacity for donor mobilization and collections) impede local procurement of this resource in sufficient volumes to meet clinical demand. This raises the question as to whether there are strategies to facilitate sharing of CCP with LMICs and/or bolstering local capacity for collection to contend with the health crisis. While compelling, there are cost-related, logistical and regulatory barriers to both approaches. For one, there is complexity in diverting national interest (e.g. in the US) away from an epidemic that displays few signs of abating. There are also concerns regarding equitable distribution of CCP in LMICs and how that might be overcome. Further, the barriers to blood donation in general apply to collection of CCP; these obstacles are longstanding, accounting for the inability of many LMICs to meet their blood transfusion needs. Nonetheless, CCP affords dual opportunity for humanitarian outreach while tackling a broader challenge of blood transfusion safety and availability."
Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7 expressing dimeric tandem-repeat spike protein RBD protects mice against COVID-19.,"A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have been approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD), or tandem-repeat dimeric RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. AdC7-RBD-tr2-elicted sera preserved the neutralizing activity against the circulating variants, especially the Delta variant. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate."
Can mRNA Vaccines Turn the Tables During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Current Status and Challenges.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people across the world. The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation."
The reliability of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing - a pilot study in asymptomatic health care workers in a Croatian university hospital.,"Aim: To evaluate three fully automated serological assays in terms of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and perform SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing among asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) at the University Hospital Center Zagreb. Methods: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays. Results: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens."
A computational simulation platform for designing real-time monitoring systems with application to COVID-19.,"With the aim of contributing to the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous strategies have been proposed. While developing an effective vaccine can take months up to years, detection of infected patients seems like one of the best ideas for controlling the situation. The role of biosensors in containing highly pathogenic viruses, saving lives and economy is evident. A new competitive numerical platform specifically for designing microfluidic-integrated biosensors is developed and presented in this work. Properties of the biosensor, sample, buffer fluid and even the microfluidic channel can be modified in this model. This feature provides the scientific community with the ability to design a specific biosensor for requested point-of-care (POC) applications. First, the validation of the presented numerical platform against experimental data and then results and discussion, highlighting the important role of the design parameters on the performance of the biosensor is presented. For the latter, the baseline case has been set on the previous studies on the biosensors suitable for SARS-CoV, which has the highest similarity to the 2019 nCoV. Subsequently, the effects of concentration of the targeted molecules in the sample, installation position and properties of the biosensor on its performance were investigated in 11 case studies. The presented numerical framework provides an insight into understanding of the virus reaction in the design process of the biosensor and enhances our preparation for any future outbreaks. Furthermore, the integration of biosensors with different devices for accelerating the process of defeating the pandemic is proposed."
A network-based model to explore the role of testing in the epidemiological control of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: Testing is one of the most effective means to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. Methods: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. Results: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals' infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. Conclusions: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume. Thus, it is highly recommended that testing be adopted in combination with measures such as wearing masks and social distancing to better manage infectious diseases. Our research contributes to understanding the role of testing in epidemic control and provides useful suggestions for the government and individuals in responding to epidemics."
False-negative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: consideration in obstetrical care.,"Because the obstetrical population seems to have a high proportion of asymptomatic patients who are carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, universal testing has been proposed as a strategy to risk-stratify all obstetrical admissions and guide infection prevention protocols. Here, we describe a case of a critically ill obstetrical patient with all the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 and 3 false-negative results of nasopharyngeal swabs for molecular testing. We review and discuss the uncertain clinical characteristics of current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 molecular testing and the implications of false-negative results in the obstetrical population."
"COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nepal, emerging UK variant and futuristic vaccination strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.","With the emergence of the new variants of concern (VOC) of the SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of certain vaccines against them requires further research and considerations for future scenarios of COVID-19 vaccination. The vaccines' lack of efficacy against VOC will pose at risk to the vaccinated population and is a public health threat. In this commentary, we discuss Nepal's recent experiences and expectations regarding the confirmation of VOC B.1.1.7 from the United Kingdom in the country."
Reliability of induced sputum test is greater than that of throat swab test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19: A multi-center cross-sectional study.,"We previously reported that sputum induction was more sensitive than throat swabs for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in two convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients; however, the value and safety of induced sputum testing require further study. We conducted a prospective multi-center cross-sectional study to compare induced sputum to throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Confirmed COVID-19 patients from six hospitals in six cities across China who received one or more negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, and paired specimens (induced sputum and throat swabs; 56 cases) were assayed. In three paired samples, both the induced sputum and throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive rate for induced sputum was significantly higher than for throat swabs both overall (28.6% vs 5.4%, respectively; p < 0.01). Patients were divided according to time span from onset of illness to sample collection into the more-than-30-day (n = 26) and less-than-30-day (n = 30) groups. The positive rate for induced sputum was also significantly higher than for throat swabs in the less-than-30-day group (53.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the more-than-30-day group, all paired samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate remained stable during sputum induction and no staff were infected. Because induced sputum is more reliable and has a lower false-negative rate than throat swabs, we believe induced sputum is more useful for the confirmation of COVID-19 and is safer as a criterion for release from quarantine."
Design of an effective piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor for rapid detection of COVID-19.,"Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, is one of the most contagious viruses resulting in a progressive pandemic. Since specific antiviral treatments have not been developed yet and its fatal rate is almost high, early and fast detection is critical for controlling the outbreak. In this study, a piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor has been designed for detecting COVID-19 samples directly without requiring preparation steps. The biosensor acts as a transducer and is coated with the related antibody. When the SARS-CoV-2 antigens adsorbed on the microcantilever top surface through their spike proteins, a surface stress due to the mass change would be prompted leading to the measurable tip deflection and floating voltage. To obtain a biosensor with optimum parameters, different shapes and piezoelectric materials have been assessed and it was concluded that a Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) biosensor in a shape of a holed punched form triangle, represented the best result. Therefore, the highly sensitive microcantilever biosensor can detect COVID-19 in clinical samples with various viral loads, rapidly. Also, it is selective enough to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses with similar symptoms."
Anaphylaxis associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Approach to allergy investigation.,"Reports about cases of anaphylaxis to mRNA vaccines have created anxiety in the community and could increase vaccine hesitancy in the population. There are no standardized protocols for allergy testing to mRNA vaccines. PEG is currently the only excipient in both vaccines with recognized allergenic potential. Allergy to PEG has been reported with increasing frequency over recent years, often in patients who had repeated systemic allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to several classes of drugs before diagnosis. Proposed protocols are based on current knowledge about potential mechanisms of anaphylaxis associated with the mRNA vaccines, and the assumption that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most likely culprit. Allergy testing to PEGs and mRNA vaccines is complex and carries the risk of anaphylaxis and should be conducted in a specialist drug allergy center. Appropriate PEG-free emergency medical treatment and supervision should be readily available."
Prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among operating room and critical care staff at a tertiary teaching hospital: A cross-sectional study.,"Objectives: To identify the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among operating room and critical care staff. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 319 Healthcare workers employed in the operation theater and intensive care unit of King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), a tertiary teaching hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between August 9, 2020 and November 2, 2020. All participants completed a 20-item questionnaire on demographic data and COVID-19 risk factors and provided blood samples. Antibody testing was performed using an in-house enzyme immunoassay and microneutralization test. Results: Of the 319 participants, 39 had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Five of them had never experienced any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and only 19 were previously diagnosed with COVID-19. The odds of developing COVID-19 or having corresponding antibodies increased if participants experienced COVID-19 symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-7.5) or reported contact with an infected family member (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.5-11.2). Disease acquisition was not associated with employment in the ICU and involvement in the intubation of or close contact with COVID-19 patients. Of the 19 previously diagnosed participants, 6 did not possess any detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Conclusions: Healthcare workers may have undiagnosed COVID-19, and those previously infected may not have long-lasting immunity. Therefore, hospitals must continue to uphold strict infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Prototype Development of an Expert System of Computerized Clinical Guidelines for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Management in Saudi Arabia.,"The increasing number of COVID-19 patients has increased health care professionals' workloads, making the management of dynamic patient information in a timely and comprehensive manner difficult and sometimes impossible. Compounding this problem is a lack of health care professionals and trained medical staff to handle the increased number of patients. Although Saudi Arabia has recently improved the quality of its health services, there is still no suitable intelligent system that can help health practitioners follow the clinical guidelines and automated risk assessment and treatment plan remotely, which would allow for the effective follow-up of patients of COVID-19. The proposed system includes five sub-systems: an information management system, a knowledge-based expert system, adaptive learning, a notification and follow-up system, and a mobile tracker system. This study shows that, to control epidemics, there is a method to overcome the shortage of specialists in the management of infections in Saudi Arabia, both today and in the future. The availability of computerized clinical guidance and an up-to-date knowledge base play a role in Saudi health organizations, which may not have to constantly train their physician staff and may no longer have to rely on international experts, since the expert system can offer clinicians all the information necessary to treat their patients."
"Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal cohort of people with COVID-19 and their household members to study factors associated with disease severity: the Predi-COVID study.","Introduction: A few major clinical factors such as sex, obesity or comorbidities have already been associated with COVID-19 severity, but there is a need to identify new epidemiological, clinical, digital and biological characteristics associated with severity and perform deep phenotyping of patients according to severity. The objectives of the Predi-COVID study are (1) to identify new determinants of COVID-19 severity and (2) to conduct deep phenotyping of patients by stratifying them according to risk of complications, as well as risk factors for infection among household members of Predi-COVID participants (the Predi-COVID-H ancillary study). Methods and analysis: Predi-COVID is a prospective, hybrid cohort study composed of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg who will be followed up remotely for 1 year to monitor their health status and symptoms. Predi-COVID-H is an ancillary cohort study on household members of index cases included in Predi-COVID to monitor symptoms and household clusters in this high-risk population. A subcohort of up to 200 Predi-COVID and 300 Predi-COVID-H participants with biological samples will be included. Severity of infection will be evaluated by occurrence and duration of hospitalisation, admission and duration of stay in intensive care units or equivalent structures, provision of and duration of supplemental oxygen and ventilation therapy, transfer to another hospital, as well as the impact of infection on daily activities following hospital discharge. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by the National Research Ethics Committee of Luxembourg (study number 202003/07) in April 2020. An informed consent is signed by study participants. Scientific articles will be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals, along with press releases for lay audience for major results. Trial registration number: NCT04380987."
"Diabetes and COVID-19: The past, the present, and the future.","Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic."
In-silico nucleotide and protein analyses of S-gene region in selected zoonotic coronaviruses reveal conserved domains and evolutionary emergence with trajectory course of viral entry from SARS-CoV-2 genomic data.,"Introduction: the recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type (COVID-19) has necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to combat the pandemic now and in the future. Methods: we analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus (229E) and zoonotic coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. Results: conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike (S) gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARS-CoV-2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship (95.6%) with pangolin coronaviruses (S) gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS-CoV-2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Conclusion: phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks."
"Had COVID-19 spread in the community before the first confirmed case in Nagasaki, Japan?","This retrospective study evaluated stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from Japanese patients with influenza-like illness during the 2019/2020 season. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 had spread in the community before the first confirmed case. The period of influenza season during 2019/2020 in Nagasaki was shorter than in previous influenza seasons. When the first COVID-19 case was reported in Nagasaki prefecture, the number of influenza cases were very low. No positive results for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 182 samples that were obtained from adult outpatients. Our results revealed no large-scale spread of COVID-19 in the community before the first confirmed case."
Vaccinating the oldest against COVID-19 saves both the most lives and most years of life.,"Many competing criteria are under consideration for prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination. Two criteria based on age are demographic: lives saved and years of future life saved. Vaccinating the very old against COVID-19 saves the most lives, but, since older age is accompanied by falling life expectancy, it is widely supposed that these two goals are in conflict. We show this to be mistaken. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality are such that vaccinating the oldest first saves the most lives and, surprisingly, also maximizes years of remaining life expectancy. We demonstrate this relationship empirically in the United States, Germany, and South Korea and with mathematical analysis of life tables. Our age-risk results, under usual conditions, also apply to health risks."
Mental Health Issues During and After COVID-19 Vaccine Era.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for more than a year, and post-COVID-19 sequelae of neurological complications, including direct and indirect effects on the central nervous system (CNS), have been recognized. There is a plethora of evidence for neurological, cognitive, and emotional deficits in COVID-19 patients. Acute neurological symptoms like neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, loss of smell, and brain stroke are common direct effects among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Work-associated stress, lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantine in response to contain SARS-CoV-2 have also affected the mental health of large populations, regardless of age. Public health emergencies have affected individuals and communities, resulting in emotional reactions and unhealthy behaviors. Although vaccines have been widely distributed and administered among large populations, vaccine hesitancy still exists and may be due to apprehension about vaccine efficacy, preliminary trials, and associated side effects. This review highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the CNS by outlining direct and indirect effects and factors contributing to the decline in people's mental health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic both during and after vaccine administration. Furthermore, we also discuss reasons for vaccine hesitancy and why some groups of people are deprived of vaccines. Finally, we touched upon the social determinants of mental health and their impact on disadvantaged populations during times of crisis which may help policymakers set up some action plans to mitigate the COVID-19 mental health turmoil during this ongoing pandemic."
The Main Molecular and Serological Methods for Diagnosing COVID-19: An Overview Based on the Literature.,"Diagnostic tests have been considered as the main alternative for the control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a correct diagnosis allows for decision making when facing the disease, particularly as there is a lack of effective therapeutic protocols and vaccines. Thus, in this review, we summarized the main diagnostic approaches currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans based on studies available in article databases. The tests can be organized into two main categories: nucleic acid-based tests, recommended for the initial detection of the virus, and serological tests, recommended for assessing the disease progression. The studies have shown that the performance of diagnostic methods depends on different factors, such as the type of samples and the characteristics of each assay. It was identified that the positivity of the tests is mainly related to the onset of symptoms. We also observed that point-of-care diagnoses are considered as one of the main trends in this area, due to the low-cost and simplicity of the assay; however, the analytical performance must be critically analyzed. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of diagnostic technologies in the control of infectious diseases."
Estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and epidemiological parameters with uncertainty from serological surveys.,"Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions."
Recent Hydroxychloroquine Use Is Not Significantly Associated with Positive PCR Results for SARS-CoV-2: A Nationwide Observational Study in South Korea.,"Background: To evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as pre-exposure prophylaxis against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the prevalence of positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing according to recent HCQ use in patients who had been tested using nationwide health-insurance data of South Korea. Methods: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 20 January 2020 to 15 May 2020 were identified. HCQ users were defined as patients who had been pretreated with HCQ for at least 30 days until the date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 was compared between HCQ users and nonusers. Results: Of a total of 216,686 individuals who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, 743 (0.3%) were pretreated with HCQ. The prevalence of positive results was not significantly different between HCQ users (2.2%) and nonusers (2.7%; P = 0.35), with an odds ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48-1.30). Propensity score-matched-cohort analysis showed similar results in terms of the prevalence of positive results (2.2% in HCQ users vs. 3.1% in nonusers; P = 0.18), with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.40-1.19). The rate of positive PCR was not significantly different in long-term HCQ users (more than 3 or 6 months) compared with nonusers. Conclusions: In this population-based study, recent exposure to HCQ was not significantly associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data do not support the use of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19."
COVID-19 and vaccination rollout in Fiji: Challenges caused by digital platform.,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, a variety of interventions have reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and mortality, including individual precautions such as wearing proper personal protective equipment (i.e., hand gloves, facemasks, and face shields), social distancing, handwashing, and limiting interpersonal interaction to outside situations. The most promising hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic is the successful launch of COVID-19 vaccines. In response, this letter to editor will disclose the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination and challenges caused by digital platforms in Fiji."
Genomic Evidence of In-Flight Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Despite Predeparture Testing.,"Since the first wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of October 20, 2020, of 62,698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on September 29, test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in 1 sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely."
Structural Basis for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Recognition by Single-Domain Antibodies.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is the most severe public health event of the twenty-first century. While effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, there remains an urgent need for diagnostics to quickly and accurately detect infections. Antigen tests, particularly those that detect the abundant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, are a proven method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of three llama-derived single-domain antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein with high affinity. Each antibody recognizes a specific folded domain of the protein, with two antibodies recognizing the N-terminal RNA binding domain and one recognizing the C-terminal dimerization domain. The two antibodies that recognize the RNA binding domain affect both RNA binding affinity and RNA-mediated phase separation of the Nucleocapsid protein. All three antibodies recognize highly conserved surfaces on the Nucleocapsid protein, suggesting that they could be used to develop affordable diagnostic tests to detect all circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants."
SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Where Are We Now?,"The best and safest way to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is by using vaccination to generate widespread immunity. The urgent need to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was met with unprecedented speed and action from the global community. There are now 289 vaccines in the development pipeline. More remarkably, there are 20 publicly available vaccines, and more than 3.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 180 countries. This is just the beginning of our fight against the pandemic. Even at the current vaccination rate, it could take years to vaccinate the world's population; many high-income countries are focusing on their needs, whereas the poorer nations are waiting for vaccines. There is still much that we do not understand about immunity to this new disease, and we will have to contend with the emerging variants. In this commentary, we describe the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and provide insights into how the development and approvals happened so quickly. We discuss the clinical trial data that led to rapid emergency use authorization and the many challenges of global rollout. We also comment on some of the key unanswered questions and future directions for COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment."
COVID-19 molecular level laboratory diagnoses.,"AbstractAIMS: Aims: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused not only global pandemic, but it also pointed at unprepared health care systems and countermeasures were introduced under the pressure of urgent circumstances. This review is focused on discussion and critical evaluation of instrumental tools for COVID-19 diagnosis that were developed in the last months. Methods: Survey of actual literature and scientific reports was made. The most substantial analytical and diagnostical methods were identified and described. Principles and limitations of the methods are described, and actual papers are cited in this review. Results: Analytical and diagnostical methods like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Lateral Flow Immunochromatography Assay (LFIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), biosensors and ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA) are discussed for assay of viral particles, antigens and specific host antibodies in blood, serum, plasma, nasopharyngeal swab and other samples in order to diagnose COVID-19. Conclusions: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has spread over the world since the end of year 2019. The global epidemic pointed at the necessity to introduce sensitive methods for instrumental diagnosis of COVID-19 and distinguishing it from the other viral diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 96)."
Serum pooling for rapid expansion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing capacity.,"Objectives: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity. Methods: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches. Results: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool. Conclusions: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors."
"Proactive Engagement of the Expert Meeting in Managing the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Epidemic, Japan, February-June 2020.","To deal with the risk of emerging diseases with many unknowns, close and timely collaboration and communication between science experts and policymakers are crucial to developing and implementing an effective science-based intervention strategy. The Expert Meeting, an ad hoc medical advisory body, was established in February 2020 to advise Japan's COVID-19 Response Headquarters. The group played an important role in the policymaking process, promoting timely situation awareness and developing science-based proposals on interventions that were promptly reflected in government actions. However, this expert group may have been overly proactive in taking on the government's role in crisis management. For the next stage of managing the coronavirus disease pandemic and future pandemics, the respective roles of the government and its advisory bodies need to be clearly defined. Leadership and strategic risk communication by the government are key."
Italian association for the study of the liver position statement on SARS-CoV2 vaccination.,"The vaccination campaign against Sars-CoV-2 commenced in Italy at the end of December 2020. The first ones to receive the immunization against the virus were the health workers and the residents of nursing homes, following which the vaccine would be available for the entire population, beginning with the most vulnerable individuals. SARS-CoV2 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe for the general population, although no data for patients with liver diseases or those having undergone liver transplantation are available so far. The present position statement AISF is an attempt to suggest, based on the published data on the impact of Sars-Cov-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease, a possible priority for vaccination for this category of patients."
Disease-modifying therapies and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in multiple sclerosis: an expert consensus.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has quickly become a global pandemic. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA beta coronavirus phylogenetically similar to SARS coronavirus. To date, more than 132 million cases of COVID19 have been recorded in the world, of which over 2.8 million were fatal ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ). A huge vaccination campaign has started around the world since the end of 2020. The availability of vaccines has raised some concerns among neurologists regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) taking immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies."
NOX2 Activation in COVID-19: Possible Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading contagious infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily affects the respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation. To date, there is no clinical treatment capable of counteracting its activation, however, NOX2 could be a promising pharmaceutical target useful for both the treatment and prevention of NDs and COVID-19 treatment."
One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine exponentially increases antibodies in individuals who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19.,"BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 vaccines currently in use require 2 doses to achieve optimal protection. Currently, there is no indication as to whether individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be vaccinated, or whether they should receive 1 or 2 vaccine doses.METHODSWe tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 health care professionals, of whom 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with or without symptoms.RESULTSPostvaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5 to 18 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate linear regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG prevaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those who voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain, and fever markedly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose.CONCLUSIONOne vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies, suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04387929.FUNDINGDolce & Gabbana and the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca corrente)."
A combined approach of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis as a potential tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs.,"Coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely recognized as the critical point in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Currently, the diagnosis is based on molecular real time RT-PCR techniques, although their implementation is being threatened due to the extraordinary demand for supplies worldwide. That is why the development of alternative and / or complementary tests becomes so relevant. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology combined with machine learning algorithms, for the detection of COVID-19 positive and negative protein profiles directly from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to the preliminary results obtained, accuracy = 67.66 %, sensitivity = 61.76 %, specificity = 71.72 %, and although these parameters still need to be improved to be used as a screening technique, mass spectrometry-based methods coupled with multivariate analysis showed that it is an interesting tool that deserves to be explored as a complementary diagnostic approach due to the low cost and fast performance. However, further steps, such as the analysis of a large number of samples, should be taken in consideration to determine the applicability of the method developed."
Immunogenicity of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in nonhuman primates and humans.,"Multiple preventive vaccines are being developed to counter the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The leading candidates have now been evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and human phase 1 and/or phase 2 clinical trials. Several vaccines have already advanced into phase 3 efficacy trials, while others will do so before the end of 2020. Here, we summarize what is known of the antibody and T cell immunogenicity of these vaccines in NHPs and humans. To the extent possible, we compare how the vaccines have performed, taking into account the use of different assays to assess immunogenicity and inconsistencies in how the resulting data are presented. We also review the outcome of challenge experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in immunized macaques, while noting variations in the protocols used, including but not limited to the virus challenge doses. Press releases on the outcomes of vaccine efficacy trials are also summarized."
"Emerging roles of extracellular vesicles in COVID-19, a double-edged sword?","The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-infected disease (COVID-19), initiated from Wuhan, China, has rapidly grown into a global pandemic. Emerging evidence has implicated extracellular vesicles (EVs), a key intercellular communicator, in the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19. In the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cells that express ACE2 and CD9 can transfer these viral receptors to other cells via EVs, making recipient cells more susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Once infected, cells release EVs packaged with viral particles that further facilitate viral spreading and immune evasion, aggravating COVID-19 and its complications. In contrast, EVs derived from stem cells, especially mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, alleviate severe inflammation (cytokine storm) and repair damaged lung cells in COVID-19 by delivery of anti-inflammatory molecules. These therapeutic beneficial EVs can also be engineered into drug delivery platforms or vaccines to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, EVs from diverse sources exhibit distinct effects in regulating viral infection, immune response, and tissue damage/repair, functioning as a double-edged sword in COVID-19. Here, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the pathological roles of EVs in COVID-19. A comprehensive discussion of the therapeutic effects/potentials of EVs is also provided."
Diagnosing COVID-19: Did We Miss Anything?,"In late 2019, a mass of patients showing symptoms of a pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan, China. Little did the world know it was the prelude of what would be a devastating pandemic. Samples were collected from these patients and the use of unbiased sequencing, and subsequent isolation of the pathogen using human airway epithelial cells led to the discovery of a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The disease caused by this virus is officially called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in health care workers: Preliminary report of a single center study.,"Serological surveys have been conducted to establish prevalence for COVID-19 antibodies in various cohorts and communities, reporting a wide range of outcomes. The prevalence of such antibodies among healthcare workers, presumed at higher risk for infection, has been increasingly investigated, more studies are needed to better understand the risks and infection transmission in different healthcare settings. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001), and loss of smell (p < .001), but not for occupations (p = .710). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage, and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity, as recently described, may possibly play a greater role in healthcare workers than in the general population."
Comparison of Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swab Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Detection of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Results: The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs."
Transmission of COVID-19 virus by droplets and aerosols: A critical review on the unresolved dichotomy.,"The practice of social distancing and wearing masks has been popular worldwide in combating the contraction of COVID-19. Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of virus-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science-based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world."
Infection sustained by lineage B.1.1.7 of SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by longer persistence and higher viral RNA loads in nasopharyngeal swabs.,"Following the announcement on December 2020 about the emergence of a new variant (VOC 202012/ 01, B.1.1.7 lineage) in the United Kingdom, a targeted surveillance was put in place in the Abruzzo region (Italy), which allowed detection of 313 persons affected by lineage B.1.1.7, up to the 20th of February 2021. We investigated the results of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs tested from December 2020 to February 2021 to verify any difference on the viral load and persistence between people infected by lineage B.1.1.7 and others. Statistically significant lower values of CT associated with the detection of the N protein encoding gene (CT N) were observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (median CT N = 15.8)in comparison to those infected by other lineages (median CT N = 16.9). A significantly longer duration of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (16 days) in comparison to those infected by other lineages (14 days)."
First detection and molecular analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from a naturally infected cat from Argentina.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread worldwide. Studies of transmission of the virus carried out in animals have suggested that certain animals may be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in pets (18 cats and 20 dogs) from owners previously confirmed as COVID-19-positive. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were taken and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assays, while blood samples were taken for antibody detection. Of the total pets analyzed, one cat was found reactive to SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR of an oropharyngeal and a rectal swab. This cat presented only sneezing as a clinical sign. Serological analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies in the serum sample from this cat, as well as in the serum from another cat non-reactive to real-time RT-PCR. Complete sequence and phylogenetic analysis allowed determining that the SARS-CoV-2 genome belonged to the B.1.499 lineage. This lineage has been reported in different provinces of Argentina, mainly in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. This study notifies the first detection of the natural infection and molecular analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat from Argentina whose owner where COVID-19-positive. Although there is currently no evidence that cats can spread COVID-19, results suggest that health authorities should test pets with COVID-19-positive owners."
Analytical validity of nanopore sequencing for rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis.,"Viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides critical insight into the transmission and evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, here we perform viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. We report that, despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >99% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives."
"[Epidemiological aspects, clinic and control mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Situation in Spain].","In January 2020, the Chinese authorities confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus of the coronavirus family. On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide. Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed. The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations. In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death. SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects. In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility. These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak."
"Assessment of Potential Risk Factors for 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Infection among Health Care Workers in a Tertiary Care Hospital, North India.","Introduction: Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. They are at more risk of contracting the infection. This study was planned to assess potential risk factors of 2019-novel coronavirus infection among HCWs working in a health facility and to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among them. Methods: A study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital among HCWs who were directly or indirectly involved in the management of a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. The socio-demographic characteristics, history of exposure, IPC measures followed and clinical symptoms were compared between health care workers in COVID and non-COVID areas. Results: Majority (45%) of HCWs were nurses, followed by hospital/sanitary/technical attendants (30%) and doctors (24%). Out of a total of 256 HCWs, 2% tested positive. Around 80% of HCWs had ever attended any IPC training. A statistically significant association was found between posting area of HCWs and their exposure to COVID patients (duration of exposure, PPE has worn by HCWs, direct contact of HCWs with the patient's material) and COVID positivity (P value <.001). Conclusion: If health care workers were trained and take adequate precautions then the risk of getting an infection is minimized."
"The Novel Coronavirus and Haemostatic Abnormalities: Pathophysiology, Clinical Manifestations, and Treatment Recommendations.","The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-C0V-2 virus, was initially considered and managed in a similar manner to the previous SARS epidemic as they are both caused by coronaviruses. What has now become apparent is that a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is abnormal thrombosis. This thrombosis occurs on a macro- and microvascular level and is unique to this disease. The virus has been demonstrated in the endothelium of the pulmonary alveoli and as such is thought to contribute to the devastating respiratory complications encountered. D-dimer concentrations are frequently raised in COVID to levels not frequently seen previously. The optimal anticoagulation treatment in COVID remains to be determined, and the myriad of pathophysiologic effects caused by this virus in the human host have also yet to be fully elucidated."
Diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19 severity: can biochemical tests and machine learning be used as prognostic indicators?,"Objective: This study aimed to implement and evaluate machine learning based-models to predict COVID-19' diagnosis and disease severity. Methods: COVID-19 test samples (positive or negative results) from patients who attended a single hospital were evaluated. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised according to the severity of the disease. Data were submitted to exploratory analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) to detect outlier samples, recognise patterns, and identify important variables. Based on patients' laboratory tests results, machine learning models were implemented to predict disease positivity and severity. Artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and K nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN) models were used. The four models were validated based on the accuracy (area under the ROC curve). Results: The first subset of data had 5,643 patient samples (5,086 negatives and 557 positives for COVID-19). The second subset included 557 COVID-19 positive patients. The ANN, DT, PLS-DA, and KNN models allowed the classification of negative and positive samples with >84% accuracy. It was also possible to classify patients with severe and non-severe disease with an accuracy >86%. The following were associated with the prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and severity: hyperferritinaemia, hypocalcaemia, pulmonary hypoxia, hypoxemia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, low urinary pH, and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that all the models could assist in the diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19 severity."
Routine saliva testing for the identification of silent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers.,"Objective: Current COVID-19 guidelines recommend symptom-based screening and regular nasopharyngeal (NP) testing for healthcare personnel in high-risk settings. We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. Design: Simulation modeling study. Methods: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the presymptomatic stage. Results: Routine biweekly NP testing, once every 2 weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD, 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD, 0.98) during the presymptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD, 0.18) and 32.9% (SD, 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified ~10% more cases (mean, 42.5%; SD, 1.10) during the presymptomatic stage. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the utility of routine noninvasive saliva testing for frontline healthcare workers to protect vulnerable patient populations. A 5-day saliva testing schedule should be considered to help identify silent infections and prevent outbreaks in nursing homes and healthcare facilities."
A Guide to COVID-19: a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic. In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS. Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces. Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the United States and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis. Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines."
More Than Just Gene Therapy Vectors: Lentiviral Vector Pseudotypes for Serological Investigation.,"Serological assays detecting neutralising antibodies are important for determining the immune responses following infection or vaccination and are also often considered a correlate of protection. The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis. Finally, we evaluate their role as surrogates for the real virus and possible alternatives."
"A description of events surrounding the index COVID-19 diagnosis in a staff member at Kalafong Provincial Tertiary Hospital in Gauteng, South Africa.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented a huge challenge to the health systems across the world. When the virus hit South Africa, and the state of national disaster was announced by the president, the healthcare system had to work on its COVID-19 response preparedness. Initially, a few hospitals were then designated facilities for managing COVID-19 patients. Kalafong Hospital, which was not amongst a list of designated facilities for COVID-19 was forced to evaluate its level of preparedness after an intern doctor tested positive. The objectives of this report are to illustrate the hospital's response around the management of the index case to share our facility's general response to the pandemic."
Immunotherapeutic approaches to curtail COVID-19.,"COVID-19, the disease induced by the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed an unpredictable burden on the world. Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions. Interferons might be helpful in some stages. Vaccine development has been followed with unprecedented speed. Some of these vaccines have been advanced to human clinical trials. Convalescent plasma therapy is already practiced in many countries to help save the lives of severely ill patients. Different antibodies that target various steps of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or the associated immune responses are also proposed. For treating the cytokine storm induced at a late stage of the disease in some patients, immune modulation through JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, and some other cognate classes are evaluated. Given the changing pattern of cytokine induction and immune responses throughout the COVID-19 disease course, different adapted approaches are needed to help patients. Gaining more knowledge about the detailed pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its interplay with the immune system, and viral-mediated responses are crucial to identify efficient preventive and therapeutic approaches. A systemic approach seems essential in this regard."
A mini-review on the effects of COVID-19 on younger individuals.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has uprooted our lives like never before since its onset in the late December 2019. The world has seen mounting infections and deaths over the past few months despite the unprecedented measures countries are implementing, such as lockdowns, social distancing, mask-wearing, and banning gatherings in large groups. Interestingly, young individuals seem less likely to be impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. While the rate of transmission, symptom presentation, and fatality is lower in children than people from other age groups, they have been disproportionately affected by strict lockdown measures needed to curb viral spread. In this review, we describe the association between patient age and COVID-19, epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, psychological effects associated with lockdowns and school closures, and possible mechanisms underlying lower transmission rate of COVID-19 in children."
Malignant cerebral infarction after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination: a catastrophic variant of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia with cerebral venous thrombosis is a syndrome recently described in young adults within two weeks from the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Here we report two cases of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct and thrombocytopenia 9-10 days following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The two cases arrived in our facility around the same time but from different geographical areas, potentially excluding epidemiological links; meanwhile, no abnormality was found in the respective vaccine batches. Patient 1 was a 57-year-old woman who underwent decompressive craniectomy despite two prior, successful mechanical thrombectomies. Patient 2 was a 55-year-old woman who developed a fatal bilateral malignant MCA infarct. Both patients manifested pulmonary and portal vein thrombosis and high level of antibodies to platelet factor 4-polyanion complexes. None of the patients had ever received heparin in the past before stroke onset. Our observations of rare arterial thrombosis may contribute to assessment of possible adverse effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan during a COVID-19 outbreak.,"The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of a COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was investigated and was compared with the number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study area during COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to >20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture; however, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected at a low frequency even when the number was below 1.0. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be detected in the early stage of the epidemic, even if the number of confirmed cases potentially underestimates the actual numbers of cases. This suggests that WBE approach can potentially act as an early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan."
The role of dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic threat to global public health. It has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild to critical illness, the most serious of which is the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection appears mild in infants and children, however, in adults, it can lead to serious consequences. In this review, we highlighted the differences between the immune responses of the lung in children and adults, immune dysregulation and their possible role in clinical manifestations in COVID-19. There is a reduction in population of immunocompetent cells during aging and subsequently induced ineffective inflammation in the faces of some infections. Dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Therefore, recognizing the differences in the immune responses of various hosts as well as to improve the immune system disorder should always be part of research and treatment protocols."
"COVID-19 in Brazil: 150,000 deaths and the Brazilian underreporting.","Brazil is one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic and has reported 5,113,628 cases and 150,998 deaths by the disease. Comparing the deaths by natural causes expected and the excess mortality rate, there is a 22% increase in deaths mainly of male patients and individuals over 60 years old."
Mutational analysis and assessment of its impact on proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India.,"Mutational status of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained through multiple tools including MEGA, Genome Detective, SIFT, PROVEAN and ws-SNPs&GO. Excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74), NSP12b (43) and ORF3a (31). Average mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198 Neutral and 83 Disease) affecting amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14 Disease variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 each. Disease mutations in genomes from asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2."
"Genomic Evolution and Variation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic in Guangdong Province, China.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with unknown origin spread rapidly to 222 countries, areas or territories. To investigate the genomic evolution and variation in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Guangdong, 60 specimens of SARS-CoV-2 were used to perform whole genome sequencing, and genomics, amino acid variation and Spike protein structure modeling analyses. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the early variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was still intra-species, with no evolution to other coronaviruses. There were one to seven nucleotide variations (SNVs) in each genome and all SNVs were distributed in various fragments of the genome. The Spike protein bound with human receptor, an amino acid salt bridge and a potential furin cleavage site were found in the SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modeling. Our study clarified the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution, variation and Spike protein structure in the early phase of local cases in Guangdong, which provided reference for generating prevention and control strategies and tracing the source of new outbreaks."
COVID-19 in pregnancy: What we know from the first year of the pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected nearly 178 million people and claimed the lives of over 3.8 million in less than 15 months. This has prompted a flurry of research studies into the mechanisms and effects of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in humans. However, studies examining the effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women, their placentae and their babies remain limited. Furthermore, reports of safety and efficacy of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are limited. This review concisely summarises the case studies and research on COVID-19 in pregnancy, to date. It also reviews the mechanism of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and its reliance and effects upon the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Overall, the data suggest that infection during pregnancy can be dangerous at any time, but this risk to both the mother and fetus, as well as placental damage, increases during the third trimester. The possibility of vertical transmission, which is explored in this review, remains contentious. However, maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 can increase risk of miscarriage, preterm birth and stillbirth, which is likely due to damage to the placenta."
Infection- and vaccine-induced antibody binding and neutralization of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein is raising concerns about the efficacy of infection- or vaccine-induced antibodies. We compared antibody binding and live virus neutralization of sera from naturally infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals against two SARS-CoV-2 variants: B.1 containing the spike mutation D614G and the emerging B.1.351 variant containing additional spike mutations and deletions. Sera from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a 3-fold reduction in binding antibody titers to the B.1.351 variant receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and a 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant compared to the B.1 variant. Similar results were seen with sera from Moderna-vaccinated individuals. Despite reduced antibody titers against the B.1.351 variant, sera from infected and vaccinated individuals containing polyclonal antibodies to the spike protein could still neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, suggesting that protective humoral immunity may be retained against this variant."
Optimal strategies for social distancing and testing to control COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 79 million individuals, with 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing."
Emerging concepts in the science of vaccine adjuvants.,"Adjuvants are vaccine components that enhance the magnitude, breadth and durability of the immune response. Following its introduction in the 1920s, alum remained the only adjuvant licensed for human use for the next 70 years. Since the 1990s, a further five adjuvants have been included in licensed vaccines, but the molecular mechanisms by which these adjuvants work remain only partially understood. However, a revolution in our understanding of the activation of the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is improving the mechanistic understanding of adjuvants, and recent conceptual advances highlight the notion that tissue damage, different forms of cell death, and metabolic and nutrient sensors can all modulate the innate immune system to activate adaptive immunity. Furthermore, recent advances in the use of systems biology to probe the molecular networks driving immune response to vaccines ('systems vaccinology') are revealing mechanistic insights and providing a new paradigm for the vaccine discovery and development process. Here, we review the 'known knowns' and 'known unknowns' of adjuvants, discuss these emerging concepts and highlight how our expanding knowledge about innate immunity and systems vaccinology are revitalizing the science and development of novel adjuvants for use in vaccines against COVID-19 and future pandemics."
"Infectious diseases epidemiology, quantitative methodology, and clinical research in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspective from a European country.","Starting from historic reflections, the current SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 pandemic is examined from various perspectives, in terms of what it implies for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the modeling and monitoring of the epidemic, the development of early-warning systems, the study of mortality, prevalence estimation, diagnostic and serological testing, vaccine development, and ultimately clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on how the pandemic had led to unprecedented speed in methodological and clinical development, the pitfalls thereof, but also the opportunities that it engenders for national and international collaboration, and how it has simplified and sped up procedures. We also study the impact of the pandemic on clinical trials in other indications. We note that it has placed biostatistics, epidemiology, virology, infectiology, and vaccinology, and related fields in the spotlight in an unprecedented way, implying great opportunities, but also the need to communicate effectively, often amidst controversy."
"Examining Australian's beliefs, misconceptions and sources of information for COVID-19: a national online survey.","Objective: Public cooperation to practise preventive health behaviours is essential to manage the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. Design: An online cross-sectional survey. Participants: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by an online panel provider. Main outcome measure: Proportion of participants with correct/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 did not qualify, 13 declined and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified 'washing your hands regularly with soap and water' (92%) and 'staying at least 1.5 m away from others' (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them from contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that 'regular use of antibiotics' would not prevent COVID-19.Most participants (90%) identified 'fever, fatigue and cough' as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to 'hold your breath for 10 s without coughing' was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%) and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). Conclusions: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appears to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long term. We need to develop public health messages that harness these barriers to improve future cooperation. Ensuring adherence to these interventions is critical."
Prioritizing Health Care and Employment Resources During COVID-19: Roles of Benevolent and Hostile Ageism.,"Background and objectives: Benevolent and hostile ageism are subtypes of ageism that characterize older adults as incompetent. With benevolent ageism, older adults are also viewed as warm. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained resources and prompted debates about priority for older adults versus other groups. Research design and methods: College students completed an online survey of how much priority should be given to older adults in 3 relevant health care-related scenarios and 3 relevant employment scenarios. Results: Benevolent ageism significantly predicted higher priority for older adults to receive health care (triage, COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 testing) and employment resources (retention of job and working from home) while greater endorsement of hostile ageism significantly predicted lower priority ratings. Discussion and implications: These findings replicate and extend past work. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on health care and employment resources, this study sheds light on one factor-benevolent and hostile ageism-that contributes to a greater understanding of prioritization views toward a vulnerable segment of the population."
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: How much do we know?,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally threatens the public health. COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV; SARS; coronavirus."
CRISPR Systems for COVID-19 Diagnosis.,"The emergence of the new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first seen in December 2019, which has spread rapidly and become a global pandemic. The number of cases of COVID-19 and its associated mortality have raised serious concerns worldwide. Early diagnosis of viral infection undoubtedly allows rapid intervention, disease management, and substantial control of the rapid spread of the disease. Currently, the standard approach for COVID-19 diagnosis globally is the RT-qPCR test; however, the limited access to kits and associated reagents, the need for specialized lab equipment, and the need for highly skilled personnel has led to a detection slowdown. Recently, the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic systems has reshaped molecular diagnosis. The benefits of the CRISPR system such as speed, precision, specificity, strength, efficiency, and versatility have inspired researchers to develop CRISPR-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods. With the global COVID-19 outbreak, different groups have begun to design and develop diagnostic and therapeutic programs based on the efficient CRISPR system. CRISPR-based COVID-19 diagnostic systems have advantages such as a high detection speed (i.e., 30 min from raw sample to reach a result), high sensitivity and precision, portability, and no need for specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we review contemporary studies on the detection of COVID-19 based on the CRISPR system."
A SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Variant that Affects Antigen Test Performance.,"More than one year into a global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a variety of rapidly evolving variant lineages. Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and CT < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics."
Using structural equation modeling to predict Indian people's attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccination.,"Background and aim: Understanding people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccination is crucial to the successful implementation of a vaccination program. Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. Results: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Conclusion: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'."
Saliva Is a Promising Alternative Specimen for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Children and Adults.,"Testing efforts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for health care workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to that of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS was compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordances for saliva and NPS were 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The values for positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS were 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva yielded detection of 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. For symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA, 82.4% versus 85.3%). The overall values for PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva yielding detection of 4 fewer cases than NPS. However, saliva performance for symptomatic adults was identical to NPS performance (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate sample choice alternative to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults."
An Optimal Nucleic Acid Testing Strategy for COVID-19 during the Spring Festival Travel Rush in Mainland China: A Modelling Study.,"Western countries are experiencing surges in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to increasing public transportation during holiday seasons. This study aimed to explore whether mainland China will face an epidemic rebound during the Spring Festival holiday, when millions of Chinese people travel across the country, and investigate which nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy is optimal to contain the epidemic. A microsimulation model was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among railway travelers and evaluated the effects of various NAT strategies. An extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was built to forecast local transmission during the Spring Festival period under different scenarios of testing strategies. The total number of infections, testing burden, and medical expenditure were calculated to devise an optimal strategy during the Spring Festival travel rush. Assuming the daily incidence of 20 per 10 million persons, our model simulated that there would be 97 active infections on the day of travel among 10 million railway passengers without NAT and symptom screening. Pre-travel testing could reduce the number of active infections. Compared with no NAT, testing passengers from risk tier 2-4 regions 3 days before travelling could significantly reduce the risk of transmission, and it is more economical and efficient than testing for all passengers."
COVID-19 in the light of current clinical eye research.,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection first reported in Wuhan city, Chinese province of Hubei, in December 2019. Previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease, COVID-19 was declared official name by the World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID-19 in February 2020. By July 2nd, 2020 10,818,005 confirmed cases with 519,467 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. The aim of this review article is to inform the audience of what is available in the current literature on how COVID-19 affects the eyes in adults, children, and elderly. PubMed search was used between December 2019 and July 2nd, 2020. Randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and letters of research, letters to editors were selected for confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to current scientific literature since the outbreak in December 2019 there have been 218 papers written. Conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctvitis have been reported in adults with COVID-19. Further studies are needed in children and geriatric patients."
Interferon-gamma release assay testing to assess COVID-19 vaccination response in a SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patient on rituximab: a case report.,"We describe the case of a 44-year-old female patient on rituximab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis with undetectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG specific antibodies 18 days after the second dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Interferon-gamma release assay testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive on day 19, demonstrating a robust T cell-mediated response despite the lack of an antibody-mediated response."
Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis.,"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3'-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses."
Decolonising human rights: how intellectual property laws result in unequal access to the COVID-19 vaccine.,"The recent rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines offers hope in addressing the worst pandemic in a hundred years. However, many countries in the Global South face great difficulties in accessing vaccines, partly because of restrictive intellectual property law. These laws exacerbate both global and domestic inequalities and prevent countries from fully realising the right to health for all their people. Commodification of essential medicines, such as vaccines, pushes poorer countries into extreme debt and reproduces national inequalities that discriminate against marginalised groups. This article explains how a decolonial framing of human rights and public health could contribute to addressing this systemic injustice. We envisage a human rights and global health law framework based on solidarity and international cooperation that focuses funding on long-term goals and frees access to medicines from the restrictions of intellectual property law. This would increase domestic vaccine production, acquisition and distribution capabilities in the Global South."
A survey on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and concern among Malaysians.,"Background: Vaccination is an effective way to curtail the burden of COVID-19 in which success depends on a high acceptance of the vaccine. However, addressing concerns among vaccine-hesitant individuals is essential to avoid failure of the immunisation programme. This study sought to assess the concerns and acceptance rates regarding the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to 1411 respondents via a snowball sampling method among Malaysians aged 18 years and above. Results: The majority of the respondents were young adults (40.7%), female (62.8%), Malay (63.8%), Muslim (72.3%), married (52.9%), with tertiary education (86.8%) and without medical illness (85%). Social media (97.4%) was the primary source of information regarding COVID-19. The overall acceptance rate was high (83.3%), with the lowest rates among the elderly aged 60 years and above (63.4%) and pensioners (64.6%). Hesitance was caused by concerns regarding side effects (95.8%), safety (84.7%), lack of information (80.9%), effectiveness (63.6%) and religious (20.8%) and cultural factors related to the COVID-19 vaccine (6.8%). Respondents with diabetes mellitus (24.7%) and hypercholesterolemia (23%) were more hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, at 16.1 and 15.8%, respectively. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were age, religion, and current residence. Conclusions: The results indicate a high rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Thus, the Malaysian government and other related agencies should increase their campaign and prepare to implement the COVID-19 mass immunisation programme among Malaysians. However, despite the high acceptance rate, it remains important to address concerns among hesitant individuals by building trust in vaccine safety and effectiveness through adequate information regarding the vaccine."
"A Review on SARS-CoV-2-Induced Neuroinflammation, Neurodevelopmental Complications, and Recent Updates on the Vaccine Development.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a devastating viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients have been increasing at an alarming rate. The mortality is much higher in older individuals, especially the ones suffering from respiratory distress, cardiac abnormalities, renal diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. Existing evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 makes its entry into human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) followed by the uptake of virions through cathepsin L or transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2-mediated abnormalities in particular cardiovascular and neurological ones and the damaged coagulation systems require extensive research to develop better therapeutic modalities. As SARS-CoV-2 uses its S-protein to enter into the host cells of several organs, the S-protein of the virus is considered as the ideal target to develop a potential vaccine. In this review, we have attempted to highlight the landmark discoveries that lead to the development of various vaccines that are currently under different stages of clinical progression. Besides, a brief account of various drug candidates that are being tested to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 was also covered. Further, in a dedicated section, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neuronal inflammation and neuronal disorders was discussed. In summary, it is expected that the content covered in this article help to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the impact on neuronal complications induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection while providing an update on the vaccine development."
[Dandelion clock-like sign on CT for diagnose of COVID-19].,"Objective: To explore the value of the ""dandelion clock-like"" sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. Results: Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia. Conclusions: The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia."
Role of rapid antibody and ELISA tests in the evaluation of serological response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity.,"From 7 to 8 days after the onset of symptoms in COVID-19 infection, the sensitivity of serological tests was found to be higher than that of nucleic acid tests. The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits. A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test. Although ELISA tests are valuable in the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the acute period, they are tests that can be used safely in the diagnosis of previous infections and seroepidemiological studies."
COVID-19 in recent heart transplant recipients: Clinicopathologic features and early outcomes.,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 on heart transplant (HTx) recipients remains unclear, particularly in the early post-transplant period. Methods: We share novel insights from our experience in five HTx patients with COVID-19 (three within 2 months post-transplant) from our institution at the epicenter of the pandemic. Results: All five exhibited moderate (requiring hospitalization, n = 3) or severe (requiring ICU and/or mechanical ventilation, n = 2) illness. Both cases with severe illness were transplanted approximately 6 weeks before presentation and acquired COVID-19 through community spread. All five patients were on immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus, and three that were transplanted within the prior 2 months were additionally on prednisone. The two cases with severe illness had profound lymphopenia with markedly elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin. All had bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest imaging. MMF was discontinued in all five, and both severe cases received convalescent plasma. All three recent transplants underwent routine endomyocardial biopsies, revealing mild (n = 1) or no acute cellular rejection (n = 2), and no visible viral particles on electron microscopy. Within 30 days of admission, the two cases with severe illness remain hospitalized but have clinically improved, while the other three have been discharged. Conclusions: COVID-19 appears to negatively impact outcomes early after heart transplantation."
"""Molecular Masks"" for ACE2 to Effectively and Safely Block SARS-CoV-2 Virus Entry.","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global health crisis, despite the development and success of vaccines in certain countries. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, uses its spike protein to bind to the human cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which allows the virus to enter the human body. Using our unique cell screening technology, we identified two ACE2-binding peptoid compounds and developed dimeric derivatives (ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1) that effectively blocked spike protein-ACE2 interaction, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into human cells. ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1 also blocked infection by a D614G mutant pseudovirus. More importantly, these compounds do not decrease ACE2 expression nor its enzyme activity (which is important in normal blood pressure regulation), suggesting safe applicability in humans."
CVnCoV and CV2CoV protect human ACE2 transgenic mice from ancestral B BavPat1 and emerging B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2.,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines. Recently, viral mutants termed variants of concern (VOC) which may escape host immunity have emerged. The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines (CVnCoV and CV2CoV) against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable, but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies."
[Case fatality rate of COVID-19: absence of epidemiological pattern].,"Objective: Analyze a set of indicators to understand the variability of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in a set of selected countries. Method: Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables. In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. Results: Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. Conclusion: Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary."
Sleep and Covid-19.,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world globally causing widespread repercussions on individuals' physical, mental and emotional well-being. In such times, sleep is likely to be affected. Objective: The aim of this study was to present the available literature on sleep and also the foresight as to the future national strategy to mitigate the effects of this pandemic. Materials and methods: An extensive literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, Epistemonikos database (https://www.epistemonikos.org), PsycINFO for available literature on the prevalence of sleep problem on COVID-19 was done. Cross-citation search was also conducted to increase relevance of the review. The key words used were- (((((((((((insomnia)) OR (sleep)) OR (sleepiness)) OR (""sleep quality"")) OR (OSA)) OR (""obstructive sleep apnoea"")) OR (""obstructive sleep apnea"")) OR ((""sleep problem"")) AND ""covid-19"" OR covid19* OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR cv19* OR ""cv-19"" OR ""cv 19"" OR ""n-cov"" OR ncov* OR ""sars-cov-2"" OR ""sars-cov2"" OR ""2019-ncov"" OR ""SARS-Coronavirus-2"" OR ""SARS-Coronavirus2"" OR (wuhan* AND (virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR (covid* AND (virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR ""covid-19-related"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2-related"" OR ""SARS-CoV2-related"" OR ""2019-nCoV-related"" OR ""cv-19-related"" OR ""n-cov-related""). Inclusion criteria consisted of articles in English, published from Jan 2020 till 19 Apr 2020. Two reviewers independently screened each research study for inclusion and eligibility. Results and conclusion: Sleep is affected during COVID-19 pandemic in patients, their families, health-care workers and their families, population in isolation, and quarantine and as such in public. Limited literature exists with subjective data and no objective criteria were found to study sleep in COVID-19 pandemic. OSA was found to be a frequent baseline characteristic of COVID-19 patients. A need to follow guidelines is of paramount importance and strategies to better sleep in the population needs to be addressed."
"Polymer-based nano-therapies to combat COVID-19 related respiratory injury: progress, prospects, and challenges.","The recent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has increased at an alarming rate, representing a substantial cause of mortality worldwide. Respiratory injuries are major COVID-19 related complications, leading to poor lung circulation, tissue scarring, and airway obstruction. Despite an in-depth investigation of respiratory injury's molecular pathogenesis, effective treatments have yet to be developed. Moreover, early detection of viral infection is required to halt the disease-related long-term complications, including respiratory injuries. The currently employed detection technique (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or qRT-PCR) failed to meet this need at some point because it is costly, time-consuming, and requires higher expertise and technical skills. Polymer-based nanobiosensing techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations. Polymeric nanomaterials have the potential for clinical applications due to their versatile features like low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and specific delivery at the targeted site of action. In recent years, innovative polymeric nanomedicine approaches have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents and support tissue growth for the inflamed organs, including the lung. This review highlights the most recent advances of polymer-based nanomedicine approaches in infectious disease diagnosis and treatments. This paper also focuses on the potential of novel nanomedicine techniques that may prove to be therapeutically efficient in fighting against COVID-19 related respiratory injuries."
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: Lights and shadows.,"Vaccines to prevent acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection elicit an immune neutralizing response. Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, largely based on case-reports of serious thromboembolic events after vaccination. Some mechanisms have been suggested which might explain the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Different vaccine platforms are currently available which include live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, vector vaccines, DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines. Vaccines increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized, the Spike proteins assembled in the cytoplasma migrate to the cell surface and protrude with a native-like conformation. These proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Such response appears to be quite vigorous in the presence of DNA vaccines which encode viral vectors, as well as in subjects who are immunized because of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting pathological features may resemble those of active coronavirus disease. The free-floating Spike proteins synthetized by cells targeted by vaccine and destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood and systematically interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by a variety of cells including platelets, thereby promoting ACE2 internalization and degradation. These reactions may ultimately lead to platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammation mediated by several mechanisms including platelet ACE2 receptors. Whereas Phase III vaccine trials generally excluded participants with previous immunization, vaccination of huge populations in the real life will inevitably include individuals with preexisting immunity. This might lead to excessively enhanced inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in occasional subjects. Further research is urgently needed in this area."
"""To Protect Myself, My Friends, Family, Workmates and Patients and to Play My Part"": COVID-19 Vaccination Perceptions among Health and Aged Care Workers in New South Wales, Australia.","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has globally caused widespread disruption, morbidity and mortality. The uptake of COVID-19 vaccination is critical for minimising further impacts of the pandemic. Health and aged care workers (HACWs) play a central role in public confidence in vaccines and are one of the priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. Qualitative phone interviews with 19 HACWs aged 21-50 years old from New South Wales, Australia, were conducted, and the data were analysed thematically in order to understand the factors influencing HACWs' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. We found that HACWs reported a continuum of COVID-19 vaccination intentions with 12 enthusiastically accepting and 7 hesitant. Using the Behavioral and Social Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination (BeSD) Framework, we found that participants' acceptance of vaccination was primarily driven by their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination (such as safety, risk and benefits) and by the information sources, people and norms they trusted. Informed by study findings, we propose several communication strategies which may be helpful in addressing HACWs vaccination acceptance. We note however that as the pandemic continues, further studies with HACWs from diverse backgrounds are needed in order to provide accurate data on diverse motivational and practical drivers of evolving perceptions and attitudes towards vaccination."
Coronavirus disease-2019 and the intestinal tract: An overview.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can progress to a severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptoms are fever and respiratory discomfort. Nevertheless, gastrointestinal infections have been reported, with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and lack of appetite. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 can remain positive in fecal samples after nasopharyngeal clearance. After gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral gastrointestinal infections, some patients may develop alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota. In addition, some COVID-19 patients may receive antibiotics, which may also disturb gastrointestinal homeostasis. In summary, the gastrointestinal system, gut microbiome, and gut-lung axis may represent an important role in the development, severity, and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, we explore the current pieces of evidence of COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations, possible implications, and interventions."
An in-well direct lysis method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real time RT-PCR in eSwab specimens.,"Background: Diagnostic real time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is usually done using nucleic acid (NA) purified from the sample. In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reagents and utensils for NA purification has been in short supply. This has generated interest in methods that eliminate the need for NA purification. Objectives: To investigate if addition of detergent to rRT-PCR master mix (MM) enabled in-well direct lysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical eSwab specimens. Study design: IGEPAL-CA-630 (IGEPAL) was added to SARS-CoV-2 MM to 0.3 % final concentration and crude sample was added directly to the PCR well containing MM. Cycle of positivity (Cp) and categorical agreement was compared in samples tested in standard rRT-PCR after NA purification and in in-well lysis, direct rRT-PCR. Results: In-well lysis direct rRT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 27/30 previously SARS-CoV-2+ samples with an average bias of 3.26 cycles (95 %CI: 0.08-6.43 cycles). All 30 previously test negative samples remained negative when tested in in-well lysis, direct PCR. Conclusions: Supplementation of detergent to MM was shown to be useful for the detection of SARS CoV-2 in eSwab specimens (COPAN) by direct rRT-PCR without prior NA purification."
Regulatory status quo and prospects for biosurfactants in pharmaceutical applications.,"The concept of going 'green' and 'cold' has led to utilizing renewable resources for the synthesis of microbial biosurfactants that are both patient and eco-friendly. In this review, we shed light on the potential and regulatory aspects of biosurfactants in pharmaceutical applications and how they can significantly contribute to novel concepts for the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and future treatment. We emphasize that more specific guidelines should be formulated to regulate the approval of biosurfactants for human use. It is also crucial to implement a risk-based approach from the early research and development (R&D) phase in addition to establishing more robust standardized techniques and assays to evaluate the characteristics of biosurfactants."
Presenting symptoms of COVID-19 and clinical outcomes in hospitalised older adults.,"Background: In July 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was recognised in the geriatric wards at a subacute campus of the Royal Melbourne Hospital affecting patients and staff. Patients were also admitted to this site after diagnosis in residential care. Aims: To describe the early symptoms and the outcomes of COVID-19 in older adults. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the facility in July or August 2020 were identified and their medical records were examined to identify symptoms present before and after their diagnosis and to determine their outcomes. Results: Overall, 106 patients were identified as having COVID-19, with median age of 84.3 years (range 41-104 years); 64 were diagnosed as hospital inpatients after a median length of stay of 49 days, 31 were transferred from residential aged care facilities with a known diagnosis and 11 were diagnosed after discharge. There were 95 patients included in an analysis of symptom type and timing onset. Overall, 61 (64.2%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19, having been diagnosed through screening initiated on site. Of these, 88.6% developed symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days. The most common initial symptom type was respiratory, but there was wide variation in presentation, including fever, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, many initially not recognised as being due to COVID-19. Of 104 patients, 32 died within 30 days of diagnosis. Conclusions: COVID-19 diagnosis is challenging due to the variance in symptoms. In the context of an outbreak, asymptomatic screening can identify affected patients early in the disease course."
Describing the epidemic trends of COVID-19 in the area covered by Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan.,"Objectives: to describe the epidemic trends of COVID-19 over time and by area in the territory covered by Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) from February to May 2020. Design: descriptive study of COVID-19 cases. Setting and participants: a new information system was developed to record COVID-19 cases with positive nasopharyngeal swab. Patients resident in the area covered by ATS-MI with symptom onset between February and May 2020 were selected. Different epidemic periods were considered based on the timeline of the various regional and national containment measures. Main outcome measures: case fatality ratios, incidence rates, and reproduction number by epidemic period and sub-area of ATS-MI. Results: a total of 27,017 swab-positive COVID-19 cases were included. Mean age was 65 years and males were 45%. Incidence in the ATS-MI area was 776 per 100,000 population. The number of deaths was 4,660, the crude case fatality ratio was 17.3%, higher in males (21.2%) than in females (14.0%). The estimated reproduction number registered its peak (3.0) in the early stages of the epidemic and subsequently decreased. Territorial differences were observed in the epidemic spread, with a higher incidence in the Lodi area. Conclusions: estimated incidence and case fatality ratios were higher than national estimates for Italy. Each ATS-MI area had different epidemic spread patterns."
Outcomes of Universal COVID-19 Testing Following Detection of Incident Cases in 11 Long-term Care Facilities.,This cross-sectional study evaluates the outcomes of universal COVID-19 testing following discovery of incident cases in 11 long-term care facilities in the US.
Molecular biology of the SARs-CoV-2 spike protein: A review of current knowledge.,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an unprecedented worldwide public health emergency. Despite the concerted efforts of the scientific field, by April 25, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had spread to over 192 countries/regions, causing more than 146 million confirmed cases including 31 million deaths. For now, an established treatment for patients with COVID-19 remains unavailable. The key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the mechanisms underlying its infectivity and pathogenicity. As a predominant focus, the coronavirus spike (S) protein is the key determinant of host range, infectivity, and pathogenesis. Thereby comprehensive understanding of the sophisticated structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein may provide insights into possible intervention strategies to fight this ongoing global pandemic. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structural and functional features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as recent updates on the cell entry mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for exploring more structure-guided strategies against SARS-CoV-2."
Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: need of a reasoned and effective vaccine campaign.,"Objectives: A strong COVID-19 vaccine campaign is needed to reach the herd immunity and reduce this pandemic infection. Study design: In the Foch Hospital, France, in February 2021, 451 healthcare workers were vaccinated by a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. Methods: Adverse effects were reported to our pharmaco-vigilance circuit, by an online and anonymous questionnaire following the first weeks of the vaccinal campaign to healthcare workers. Results: Two hundred seventy-four (60.8%) of them reported multiple adverse effects. Main adverse effects reported were feverish state/chills (65.7%), fatigue/physical discomfort (62.4%), arthralgia/muscle pain (61.0%) and fever (44.5%). Conclusions: On March 2021 many European countries suspended AstraZeneca vaccine for one week due to safety uncertainty. Thus, confidence in its efficacy is undermined. However, the benefit/risk balance is clearly in favor of vaccination."
Cross-Institutional Evaluation of the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG Immunoassay.,"Objective: To describe a cross-institutional approach to verify the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay and to document the kinetics of the serological response. Methods: We conducted analytical performance evaluation studies using the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay on 5 Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 automated analyzers at 2 academic medical centers. Results: Within-run and between-run coefficients of variance (CVs) for the antibody assay did not exceed 5.6% and 8.6%, respectively, for each institution. Quantitative and qualitative results agreed for lithium heparin plasma, EDTA-plasma and serum specimen types. Results for all SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive and -negative specimens were concordant among analyzers except for 1 specimen at 1 institution. Qualitative and quantitative agreement was observed for specimens exchanged between institutions. All patients had detectable antibodies by day 10 from symptom onset and maintained seropositivity throughout specimen procurement. Conclusions: The analytical performance characteristics of the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay within and between 2 academic medical center clinical laboratories were acceptable for widespread clinical-laboratory use."
"Strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 importation from international travellers: modelling estimations for the United Kingdom, July 2020.","BackgroundTo mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks from international air travellers, many countries implemented a combination of up to 14 days of self-quarantine upon arrival plus PCR testing in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.AimTo assess the effectiveness of quarantine and testing of international travellers to reduce risk of onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into a destination country in the pre-COVID-19 vaccination era.MethodsWe used a simulation model of air travellers arriving in the United Kingdom from the European Union or the United States, incorporating timing of infection stages while varying quarantine duration and timing and number of PCR tests.ResultsQuarantine upon arrival with a PCR test on day 7 plus a 1-day delay for results can reduce the number of infectious arriving travellers released into the community by a median 94% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 89-98) compared with a no quarantine/no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median > 99%; 95% UI: 98-100). Even shorter quarantine periods can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (median reduction 89%; 95% UI: 83-95)).ConclusionThe effect of different screening strategies impacts asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals differently. The choice of an optimal quarantine and testing strategy for unvaccinated air travellers may vary based on the number of possible imported infections relative to domestic incidence."
A Closer Look into FDA-EUA Approved Diagnostic Techniques of Covid-19.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, caused a worldwide pandemic in 2020 and is the most urgent health issue worldwide. In this review, we highlight the details of Food and Drug Administration-Emergency Use Authorizations approved diagnostics kits, focusing on the similarities and differences. It is essential to understand the currently available options and the advantages and disadvantages each provides to select the appropriate products that maximize the testing efficiency. We believe this work will provide a holistic evaluation of the current COVID-19 diagnostic resources, including variations across the countries, and guide developing novel diagnostic techniques to improve and optimize the current testing options."
Contrasting SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies and clinical symptoms in a large cohort of Colombian patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: There is limited and controverting evidence looking at possible associations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA copies and patient variables in large cohorts of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Methods: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. Results: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle thresholds reveal strong associations with a prior medical history, specific symptomatology, and disease severity markers. Further research controlling potential confounding variables needs to be conducted to evaluate the nature and usefulness of these associations in managing COVID-19 patients."
Real-time PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in Canadian laboratories.,"With emergence of pandemic COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential. This study compared laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian hospital and public health laboratories, and some commercially available real-time RT-PCR assays. Overall, analytical sensitivities were equivalent between LDTs and most commercially available methods."
"Correlating qRT-PCR, dPCR and Viral Titration for the Identification and Quantification of SARS-CoV-2: A New Approach for Infection Management.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies. Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures, which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research and diagnostics call for a model that allows the comparison between the results obtained employing different analytical methods. The aim of this study is to define a comparison among two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic routine tests. All these estimations take into consideration methodological errors linked to the qRT-PCR, dPCR and titration assays."
[Possible unregistered SARS-CoV-2 infection in a young man with anosmia and ageusia].,"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing of suspected cases in Denmark has recently been limited to those who were critically ill. This has left an increasing number of unregistered infections in the society, obscured quantification and impacted lived lives. This case story reports a possible mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthy young man in his twenties. Due to strategic guidelines, he was never tested for SARS-CoV-2, but the medical record was highly suspicious for infection. Besides the well-known symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, this case also reports total anosmia and ageusia."
"S-Gene Target Failure as a Marker of Variant B.1.1.7 Among SARS-CoV-2 Isolates in the Greater Toronto Area, December 2020 to March 2021.",This study determined the spread of the B.1.1.7 SARs-CoV-2 variant in the Greater Toronto Area over 4 months by tracking S-gene target failure as marker.
A review on current diagnostic techniques for COVID-19.,"Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread all over the world soon after that. Given the infectious nature ofSARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis tools are important to detect the virus. In this review, we discuss the different diagnostic tests that are currently being implemented in laboratories and provide a description of various COVID-19 kits. Areas covered: We summarize molecular techniques that target the viral load, serological methods used for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies detection as well as newly developed faster assays for the detection of SARS-COV 2 in various biological samples. Expert opinion: In the light of the widespread pandemic, the massive diagnosis of COVID-19, using various detection techniques, appears to be the most effective strategy for monitoring and containing its propagation."
Handling and accuracy of four rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 compared to RT-qPCR.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics is facing material shortages and long turnaround times due to exponential increase of testing demand. Objective: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). Methods: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. Results: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %). Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3-100 for both tests) and IV (CI95 %: 96.3-100) and 97 % (CI95 %: 91.5-98.9) for test III. Regarding handling, test I obtained the overall highest scores, while test II was considered to have the most convenient components. Of note, users considered all assays, with the exception of test I, to pose a significant risk for contamination by drips or spills. Discussion: Besides some differences in sensitivity and handling, all four AgPOCTs showed acceptable performance in high viral load samples. However, due to the significantly lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, a careful consideration of pro and cons of AgPOCT has to be taken into account before clinical implementation."
Dramatic Changes in Oncology Care Pathways During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The French ONCOCARE-COV Study.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have affected cancer management. We aimed to evaluate changes in every oncology care pathway essential step, from screening to treatment, during the pandemic. Monthly oncological activity differences between 2019 and 2020 (screening tests, histopathological analyzes, multidisciplinary tumor board meetings (MTBMs), diagnostic announcement procedures (DAPs), and treatments were calculated in two French areas experiencing different pandemic intensity (Reims and Colmar). COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact in terms of screening (-86% to -100%), diagnosis (-39%), and surgical treatment (-30%). This global decrease in all essential oncology care pathway steps contrasted with the relative stability of chemotherapy (-9%) and radiotherapy use (-16%). Outbreak occurred earlier and with more intensity in Colmar but had a comparable impact in both areas regarding MTMBs and DAPs. The current ONCOCARE-COV study is still in progress and with a longer follow-up to analyze postlockdown situation."
"A Web-Based Platform on Coronavirus Disease-19 to Maintain Predicted Diagnostic, Drug, and Vaccine Candidates.","A web-based resource CoronaVIR (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/coronavir/) has been developed to maintain the predicted and existing information on coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have integrated multiple modules, including ""Genomics,"" ""Diagnosis,"" ""Immunotherapy,"" and ""Drug Designing"" to understand the holistic view of this pandemic medical disaster. The genomics module provides genomic information of different strains of this virus to understand genomic level alterations. The diagnosis module includes detailed information on currently-in-use diagnostics tests as well as five novel universal primer sets predicted using in silico tools. The Immunotherapy module provides information on epitope-based potential vaccine candidates (e.g., LQLPQGTTLPKGFYA, VILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKK, EITVATSRTLS, GKGQQQQGQTV, SELVIGAVILR) predicted using state-of-the-art software and resources in the field of immune informatics. These epitopes have the potential to activate both adaptive (e.g., B cell and T cell) and innate (e.g., vaccine adjuvants) immune systems as well as suitable for all strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we have also predicted potential candidates for siRNA-based therapy and RNA-based vaccine adjuvants. The drug designing module maintains information about potential drug targets, tertiary structures, and potential drug molecules. These potential drug molecules were identified from FDA-approved drugs using the docking-based approach. We also compiled information from the literature and Internet on potential drugs, repurposing drugs, and monoclonal antibodies. To understand host-virus interaction, we identified cell-penetrating peptides in the virus. In this study, state-of-the-art techniques have been used for predicting the potential candidates for diagnostics and therapeutics."
Pharmaceutical Aspects and Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccines.,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in December 2019 and has since morphed into a global pandemic claiming over 2.4 million human lives and severely impacting global economy. The race for a safe and efficacious vaccine was thus initiated with government agencies as well as major pharmaceutical companies as frontrunners. An ideal vaccine would activate multiple arms of the adaptive immune system to generate cytotoxic T cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, while avoiding pathological or deleterious immune responses that result in tissue damage or exacerbation of the disease. Developing an effective vaccine requires an inter-disciplinary effort involving virology, protein biology, biotechnology, immunology and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the pathology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which are fundamental to vaccine development. We then summarize the rationale for developing COVID-19 vaccines and provide novel insights into vaccine development from a pharmaceutical science perspective, such as selection of different antigens, adjuvants, delivery platforms and formulations. Finally, we review multiple clinical trial outcomes of novel vaccines in terms of safety and efficacy."
Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using potential point-of-care electrochemical immunosensor: Toward the future prospects.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed."
Preparation for Quarantine on the Cruise Ship Diamond Princess in Japan due to COVID-19.,"Background: Japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in an attempt to control the spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in February 2020. Objective: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. Results: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died. Conclusions: There were several difficulties in implementing large-scale quarantine and obtaining medical support on the cruise ship. In the future, we need to prepare for patients' transfer and the admitting hospitals when disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers to control the infection. We must also draw a plan for the future, to protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships."
From the environment to the cells: An overview on pivotal factors which affect spreading and infection in COVID-19 pandemic.,"Several factors ranging from environmental risks to the genetics of the virus and that of the hosts, affect the spread of COVID-19. The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus. Given the role of environmental and nutritional factors, we discuss and recommend some strategies to prevent the disease and protect the population against COVID-19. Since an effective vaccine can prevent the transmission of communicable diseases and abolish pandemics, we added a brief review of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
Clinical Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 Testing Pressure on Clinical Laboratories: A Multinational Study Analyzing Google Trends and Over 100 Million Diagnostic Tests.,"Objective: Evidence has shown that Google searches for clinical symptom keywords correlates with the number of new weekly patients with COVID-19. This multinational study assessed whether demand for SARS-CoV-2 tests could also be predicted by Google searches for key COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: The weekly number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Italy and the United States was retrieved from official sources. A concomitant electronic search was performed in Google Trends, using terms for key COVID-19 symptoms. Results: The model that provided the highest coefficient of determination for the United States (R2 = 82.8%) included a combination of searching for cough (with a time lag of 2 weeks), fever (with a time lag of 2 weeks), and headache (with a time lag of 3 weeks; the time lag refers to the amount of time between when a search was conducted and when a test was administered). In Italy, headache provided the model with the highest adjusted R2 (86.8%), with time lags of both 1 and 2 weeks. Conclusion: Weekly monitoring of Google Trends scores for nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms is a reliable approach for anticipating SARS-CoV-2 testing demands ~2 weeks in the future."
"The Virological, Immunological, and Imaging Approaches for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Research.","In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was found to cause a highly contagious disease characterized by pneumonia. The disease (COVID-19) quickly spread around the globe, escalating to a global pandemic. In this review, we discuss the virological, immunological, and imaging approaches harnessed for COVID-19 diagnosis and research. COVID-19 shares many clinical characteristics with other respiratory illnesses.Accurate and early detection of the infection is pivotal to controlling the outbreak, as this enables case identification, isolation, and contact tracing. We summarize the available literature on current laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics, highlight their strengths and limitations, and describe the emerging diagnostic approaches on the horizon.We also discuss the various research techniques that are being used to evaluate host immunity in laboratory-confirmed patients. Additionally, pathological imaging of tissue samples from affected patients has a critical role in guiding investigations on this disease. Conventional techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, have been frequently used to characterize the immune microenvironment in COVID-19. We also outline the emerging imaging techniques, such as the RNAscope, which might also aid in our understanding of the significance of COVID-19-specific biomarkers, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor.Overall, great progress has been made in COVID-19 research in a short period. Extensive, global collation of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 will provide insights into novel treatment modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, and support the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
Prevalence of Increased FDG PET/CT Axillary Lymph Node Uptake Beyond 6 Weeks after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination.,Ipsilateral avid axillary lymph node uptake at FDG PET/CT persists in 29% (49 of 169) of patients between 7 to 10 weeks after the second dose of the mRNA-based BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination.
"Biotechnology, nanotechnology and medicine.","The 1980s mark the starting point of nanotechnology: the capacity to synthesise, manipulate and visualise matter at the nanometre scale. New powers to reach the nanoscale brought us the unprecedented possibility to directly target at the scale of biomolecular interactions, and the motivation to create smart nanostructures that could circumvent the hurdles hindering the success of traditional pharmacological approaches. Forty years on, the progressive integration of bio- and nanotechnologies is starting to produce a transformation of the way we detect, treat and monitor diseases and unresolved medical problems [ 1]. While much of the work remains in research laboratories, the first nano-based treatments, vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic devices, are now receiving approval for commercialisation and clinical use. In this special issue we review recent advances of nanomedical approaches to combat antibiotic resistance, treatment and detection of cancers, targeting neurodegerative diseases, and applications as diverse as dentistry and the treatment of tuberculosis. We also examine the use of advanced smart nanostructured materials in areas such as regenerative medicine, and the controlled release of drugs and treatments. The latter is currently poised to bring ground-breaking changes in immunotherapy: the advent of 'vaccine implants' that continuously control and improve immune responses over time. With the increasingly likely prospect of ending the COVID 19 pandemic with the aid of a nanomedicine-based vaccine (both Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines are based on lipid nanoparticle formulations), we are witnessing the coming of age of nanomedicine. This makes it more important than ever to concentrate on safety: in parallel to pursuing the benefits of nanomedine, we must strengthen the continuous focus on nanotoxicology and safety regulation of nanomedicines that can deliver the medical revolution that is within our grasp."
COVID-19 vaccines: The status and perspectives in delivery points of view.,"Due to the high prevalence and long incubation periods often without symptoms, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of individuals globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Even with the recent approval of the anti-viral drug, remdesivir, and Emergency Use Authorization of monoclonal antibodies against S protein, bamlanivimab and casirimab/imdevimab, efficient and safe COVID-19 vaccines are still desperately demanded not only to prevent its spread but also to restore social and economic activities via generating mass immunization. Recent Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine may provide a pathway forward, but monitoring of long-term immunity is still required, and diverse candidates are still under development. As the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and interactions with the immune system continues to evolve, a variety of drug candidates are under investigation and in clinical trials. Potential vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 include repurposed drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antiviral and antigenic proteins, peptides, and genetically engineered viruses. This paper reviews the virology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapies for COVID-19 to vaccination, principles and design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, and the promises and roles of vaccine carriers in addressing the unique immunopathological challenges presented by the disease."
Advances in gene-based vaccine platforms to address the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has spread across the globe at an unprecedented rate since its first emergence in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. Scientific communities around the world have been rigorously working to develop a potent vaccine to combat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), employing conventional and novel vaccine strategies. Gene-based vaccine platforms based on viral vectors, DNA, and RNA, have shown promising results encompassing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in previous studies, supporting their implementation for COVID-19 vaccine development. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently authorized the emergency use of two RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. We review current gene-based vaccine candidates proceeding through clinical trials, including their antigenic targets, delivery vehicles, and route of administration. Important features of previous gene-based vaccine developments against other infectious diseases are discussed in guiding the design and development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and future derivatives."
Assessing the Burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Healthcare Workers in Mexico City: A Data-Driven Call to Action.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) could be at increased occupational risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections due to increased exposure. Information regarding the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in HCWs living in Mexico is scarce. Here, we aimed to explore the epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. Methods: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City, in HCWs who underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We explored COVID-19 outcomes in HCWs and the performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: As of 20 September 2020, 57 758 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 531 were confirmed (30.35%); 6610 were nurses (37.70%), 4910 physicians (28.0%), 267 dentists (1.52%), and 5744 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (32.76%). Overall, 2378 HCWs required hospitalization (4.12%), 2648 developed severe COVID-19 (4.58%), and 336 required mechanical-ventilatory support (.58%). Lethality was recorded in 472 (.82%) cases. We identified 635 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.62%). Compared with general population, HCWs had higher incidence, testing, asymptomatic cases, and mortality rates. No individual symptom offers adequate performance to detect SARS-CoV2. Older HCWs with chronic noncommunicable diseases and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcome; physicians were at higher risk compared with nurses and other HCWs. Conclusions: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. Symptoms as a screening method are not efficient to discern those HCWs with a positive PCR-RT test. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes."
Factors Associated With Access to and Timing of Coronavirus Testing Among US Adults After Onset of Febrile Illness.,"Importance: Active SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) transmission continues in the US. It is unclear whether better access to coronavirus testing and more consistent use of testing could substantially reduce transmission. Objective: To describe coronavirus testing in persons with new onset of febrile illness and analyze whether there are changes over time and differences by race and ethnicity. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. Main outcomes and measures: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. Results: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge. Black participants reported receiving a test result about half as often as others (7% [7 of 103] of survey responses vs 12% [53 of 461] for Hispanic vs 13% [693 of 5516] for not Black, not Hispanic; P = .03). This association was not statistically significant in adjusted time-to-event models (hazard ratio = 0.59 vs not Black, not Hispanic participants; 95% CI, 0.26-1.34). Conclusions and relevance: Systematic underuse of coronavirus testing was observed in this cohort study through late October 2020, at the beginning of the winter COVID-19 surge, which may have contributed to preventable coronavirus transmission."
Varying presentations of COVID-19 in young heart transplant recipients: A case series.,"Background: Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. Limited data regarding clinical outcome exist in adults, whereas very little is known about the spectrum of the disease in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of young heart transplant patients from our tertiary care center during the coronavirus pandemic in New York City and identified patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We present four cases with COVID-19 disease and elaborate on their presentation and clinical course. Conclusions: Although far from conclusive and limited by the small sample size and selection bias, these cases demonstrate mild and self-limited disease despite immunosuppressive therapy and various comorbidities that are expected to increase the severity of the clinical picture based on extrapolation from the adult experience with this novel disease."
Commercialized diagnostic technologies to combat SARS-CoV2: Advantages and disadvantages.,"The current situation of the Covid-19 pandemic is indicated by a huge number of infections, high lethality, and rapid spread. These circumstances have stopped the activity of almost the entire world, affecting severely the global economy. A rapid diagnosis of the Covid-19 and a generalized testing protocol is essential to fight against the pandemic and to maintain health control in the population. Principal biosensing and diagnostic technologies used to monitor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 are based on specific genomic analysis and rapid immune tests, both with different technology platforms that include advantages and disadvantages. Most of the in vitro diagnosis companies are competing to be the first on validating under different regulations their technology for placing their platforms for Covid-19 detection as fast as possible in this big international market. A comprehensive analysis of the commercialized technologies for the genomic based sensing and the antibody/antigen detection methods devoted to Covid-19 diagnosis is described in this review, which have been detailed and listed under different countries regulations. The effectiveness of the described technologies throughout the different stages of the disease and a critical comparison of the emerging technologies in the market to counterattack this pandemic have been discussed."
Imaging findings of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19.,"Background: A hyperinflammatory immune-mediated shock syndrome has been recognised in children exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To describe typical imaging findings in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. Materials and methods: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, imaging studies and clinical data from children treated for multisystem inflammatory syndrome were collected from multiple centres. Standardised case templates including demographic, biochemical and imaging information were completed by participating centres and reviewed by paediatric radiologists and paediatricians. Results: We included 37 children (21 boys; median age 8.0 years). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15/37 (41%) children and immunoglobulins in 13/19 children (68%). Common clinical presentations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (68%), rash (54%), conjunctivitis (38%) and cough (32%). Thirty-three children (89%) showed laboratory or imaging findings of cardiac involvement. Thirty of the 37 children (81%) required admission to the intensive care unit, with good recovery in all cases. Chest radiographs demonstrated cardiomegaly in 54% and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension/congestion in 73%. The most common chest CT abnormalities were ground-glass and interstitial opacities (83%), airspace consolidation (58%), pleural effusion (58%) and bronchial wall thickening (42%). Echocardiography revealed impaired cardiac function in half of cases (51%) and coronary artery abnormalities in 14%. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial oedema in 58%, pericardial effusion in 42% and decreased left ventricular function in 25%. Twenty children required imaging for abdominal symptoms, the commonest abnormalities being free fluid (71%) and terminal ileum wall thickening (57%). Twelve children underwent brain imaging, showing abnormalities in two cases. Conclusion: Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and brain imaging findings, reflecting the multisystem inflammatory disease. Awareness of the imaging features of this disease is important for early diagnosis and treatment."
Testing COVID-19 in Brazil: fragmented efforts and challenges to expand diagnostic capacity at the Brazilian Unified National Health System.,"Since the first recorded case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020, Brazil has seen an exponential growth in the number of cases and deaths. The national testing approach has been insufficient to correctly use this tool in the support of containing the epidemic in the country. In this communication, we discuss efforts and challenges to scale-up COVID-19 testing at the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). This communication presents the initial results of the research project created to investigate the political, industrial, technological, and regulatory aspects that may affect the diagnostic and testing capacity for COVID-19 in Brazil. The paper draws on the review of academic literature, media publication, and collection of public data on tests purchase and regulation. It enlists initiatives to enhance PCR testing, national production and development of technologies, as well as regulatory measures to fast-track new tests. Our analysis indicates some points of reflection. Firstly, the lack of a consistent national strategy to fight COVID-19 exarcebated supply problems of diagnostic components. If the country was eventually able to circumvent this situation, it still faces a more structural dependency on the importation of diagnostic components. Secondly, the discontinued funding and distribution of tests may have implied health policy fragmentation and the growing importance of local governments and non-state actors to fighting the epidemics within SUS. Finally, initiatives established since the second semester of 2020 have expanded the testing capacity at SUS. However, it has not been sufficient to control the progress of the epidemic in the country."
NSP16 2'-O-MTase in Coronavirus Pathogenesis: Possible Prevention and Treatments Strategies.,"Several life-threatening viruses have recently appeared, including the coronavirus, infecting a variety of human and animal hosts and causing a range of diseases like human upper respiratory tract infections. They not only cause serious human and animal deaths, but also cause serious public health problems worldwide. Currently, seven species are known to infect humans, namely SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) structure is similar to the 5'-end capping system of mRNA used by eukaryotic hosts and plays a vital role in evading host immunity response and protects the nascent viral mRNA from degradation. NSP16 is also well-conserved among related coronaviruses and requires its binding partner NSP10 to activate its enzymatic activity. With the continued threat of viral emergence highlighted by human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, mutant strains continue to appear, affecting the highly conserved NSP16: this provides a possible therapeutic approach applicable to any novel coronavirus. To this end, current information on the 2'-O-MTase activity mechanism, the differences between NSP16 and NSP10 in human coronaviruses, and the current potential prevention and treatment strategies related to NSP16 are summarized in this review."
Vertical Transmission of COVID-19: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will continue affecting pregnant women with possibility of vertical transmissions. However, knowledge and evidences regarding vertical transmission of COVID-19 are just emerging. This information is very crucial in the obstetrical care of COVID-19 infected women as well as in the care of newborn born to COVID-19 positive mothers. We report a case of vertical transmission in a neonate born to asymptomatic COVID-19 infected mother. Newborn was immediately shifted to isolation nursery and formula feed was started. The nasopharyngeal swab of newborn taken at 42 hours of life tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Therefore the vertical transmission in COVID-19 is possible. Despite this, the neonatal outcome is good. Keywords: Duodenal atresia; flip flop circulation; neonates; persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn."
The costs of an expanded screening criteria for COVID-19: A modelling study.,"Objectives: Nosocomial infection is an ongoing concern in the COVID-19 outbreak. The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment. We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system. Methods: We explored the effects of the expanded screening criteria which allow clinicians to isolate and investigate patients presenting with undifferentiated fever or respiratory symptoms or chest x-ray abnormalities. We formulated a cost appraisal framework which evaluated the treatment costs averted from the prevention of secondary transmission in the hospital setting, as determined by a branching process infection model, and compared these to the costs of the additional testing required to meet the criteria. Results: In the base case analysis, an R0 of 2.5 and incubation period of 4 days, an estimated 239 (95% CI: 201-287) cases could be averted over 150 days within the hospital setting through ESC. A corresponding $2.36 (2-2.85) million USD in costs could be averted with net cost savings of $124,000 (95% CI: -334,000 to 516,000). In the sensitivity analyses, when positive identification rates (PIR) were above 7%, regardless of R0 and incubation period, all scenarios were cost-saving. Conclusion: The expanded screening criteria can help to identify and promptly isolate positive COVID cases in a cost-saving manner or within acceptable cost margins where the costs incurred from the testing of negative patients could be negated by the averted costs. Outbreak control must be sustainable and effective; the proposed screening criteria should be considered to mitigate nosocomial transmission risk within healthcare facilities."
False-negative results of initial RT-PCR assays for COVID-19: A systematic review.,"Background: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. Results: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. Conclusions: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very low certainty of evidence).

Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2: review of laboratory-confirmed virus in gastrointestinal system.,"Purpose: The objective was to collect the data available regarding the presence of laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in gastrointestinal system and to evaluate whether the digestive system could contribute to viral transmission. Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies documenting, in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): (1) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces; (2) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the intestinal cells; (3) live SARS-CoV-2 in the feces. Results: Twenty seven met the inclusion criteria. In 26 studies, the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces of COVID-19 patients had been reported. Out of the 671 patients, 312 (46.5%) had a positive stool sample for viral nucleic acid. Of these patients, 63.9% remained positive for viral nucleic acid in the feces after pharyngeal swabs became negative; Three studies also evaluated the viral ribonucleic acid in the gastrointestinal tissues and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was found in samples of 3 patients out of 8 examined (37.5%). The presence of the live virus in stool samples was confirmed in two studies but no in in a recent study from Germany. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells and it may be transmitted through the digestive tract. Conclusion: In order to control the pandemic, every effort should be made to understand all the possible routes of transmission of the infections, even the less important ones."
"Delayed positive COVID19 nasopharyngeal test, a case study with clinical and pathological correlation.","Background: There are various reasons for delayed positive nasopharyngeal PCR tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in not only asymptomatic but also severely diseased patients. The pathophysiological attributes are not known. We explore this possibility through a case report. Case presentation: A 64-year-old male with history of pulmonary fungal infection, asthma and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), diabetes, coronary artery disease presented with shortness of breath, fever and chest image of ground opacity, reticular interstitial thickening, highly suspicious for COVID19. However, nasopharyngeal swab tests were discordantly negative for four times in two weeks, and IgG antibody for COVID19 was also negative. However, serum IgE level was elevated. No other pathogens are identified. His symptoms deteriorated despite corticosteroid, antibiotics and bronchodilator treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and open lung wedge biopsy were performed for etiology diagnosis. They demonstrated COVID19 viral RNA positive fibrosing organizing pneumonia with respiratory tract damage characterized by suspicious viral cytopathic effect, mixed neutrophilic, lymphoplasmacytic, histiocytic and eosinophilic inflammation and fibrosis besides expected asthma and COPD change. One week later, repeated COVID19 nasopharyngeal tests on day 40 and day 49 became positive. Conclusion: Our case and literature review indicate that allergic asthma and associated high IgE level together with corticosteroid inhalation might contribute to the delayed positive nasopharyngeal swab in upper airway; COPD related chronic airways obstruction and the addition of fibrosis induced ventilator dependence and poor prognosis in COVID19 pneumonia, and should be therapeutically targeted besides antiviral therapy."
Vaccines based on replication incompetent Ad26 viral vectors: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment.,"Replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors have been under investigation as a platform to carry a variety of transgenes, and express them as a basis for vaccine development. A replication-incompetent adenoviral vector based on human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) has been evaluated in several clinical trials. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and features of recombinant viral vector vaccines. This paper reviews features of the Ad26 vectors, including tabulation of safety and risk assessment characteristics of Ad26-based vaccines. In the Ad26 vector, deletion of E1 gene rendering the vector replication incompetent is combined with additional genetic engineering for vaccine manufacturability and transgene expression optimization. These vaccines can be manufactured in mammalian cell lines at scale providing an effective, flexible system for high-yield manufacturing. Ad26 vector vaccines have favorable thermostability profiles, compatible with vaccine supply chains. Safety data are compiled in the Ad26 vaccine safety database version 4.0, with unblinded data from 23 ongoing and completed clinical studies for 3912 participants in five different Ad26-based vaccine programs. Overall, Ad26-based vaccines have been well tolerated, with no significant safety issues identified. Evaluation of Ad26-based vaccines is continuing, with >114,000 participants vaccinated as of 4th September 2020. Extensive evaluation of immunogenicity in humans shows strong, durable humoral and cellular immune responses. Clinical trials have not revealed impact of pre-existing immunity to Ad26 on vaccine immunogenicity, even in the presence of Ad26 neutralizing antibody titers or Ad26-targeting T cell responses at baseline. The first Ad26-based vaccine, against Ebola virus, received marketing authorization from EC on 1st July 2020, as part of the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen. New developments based on Ad26 vectors are underway, including a COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently in phase 3 of clinical evaluation."
"EAACI statement on the diagnosis, management and prevention of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.","The first approved COVID-19 vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162B2, Moderna mRNA-1273 and AstraZeneca recombinant adenoviral ChAdOx1-S. Soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA-based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported. Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitization. Finally, we identify unmet research needs and propose a concerted international roadmap towards precision diagnosis and management to minimize the risk of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate their broader and safer use."
Development of integrated microfluidic platform coupled with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an alarming situation across the globe. Varieties of diagnostic protocols are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Many of these diagnostic protocols however, have limitations such as for example unacceptable no of false-positive and false-negative cases, particularly during the early stages of infection. At present, the real-time (quantitative) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, RT-PCR based tests are complex, expensive, time consuming and involve pre-processing of samples. A swift, sensitive, inexpensive protocol for mass screening is urgently needed to contain this pandemic. There is urgent need to harness new powerful technologies for accurate detection not only of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also combating the emergence of pandemics of new viruses as well. To overcome the current challenges, the authors propose a diagnostic protocol based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with microfluidic devices containing integrated microchannels functionalized either with vertically aligned Au/Ag coated carbon nanotubes or with disposable electrospun micro/nano-filter membranes. These devices have the potential to successfully trap viruses from diverse biological fluids/secretions including saliva, nasopharyngeal, tear etc. These can thus enrich the viral titre and enable accurate identification of the viruses from their respective Raman signatures. If the device is successfully developed and proven to detect target viruses, it would facilitate rapid screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals of COVID-19. This would be a valuable diagnostic tool not only for mass screening of current COVID-19 pandemic but also in viral pandemic outbreaks of future."
Collection of lower respiratory specimen by bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Bronchoscopy, as an aerosol-generating procedure, is not routinely performed in patients with high-risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) owing to potential transmission to healthcare workers. However, to obtain lower respiratory specimens from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is necessary to confirm COVID-19 or other diagnosis that will change clinical management. We report a case of diagnostic difficulty with five negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in four upper respiratory tract and one stool samples following presentation with fever during the quarantine period and a strong epidemiological linkage to an index patient with COVID-19. The final diagnosis was confirmed by BAL. Special precautions to be taken when performing bronchoscopy in high-risk non-intubated patients were discussed."
[Comparison of the clinical characteristics between RNA positive and negative patients clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019].,"Objective: To raise awareness about 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and reduce missed diagnosis rate and misdiagnosis rate by comparing the clinical characteristics between RNA positive and negative patients clinically diagnosed with NCP. Methods: From January 2020 to February 2020, 54 patients who were newly diagnosed with NCP in Wuhan Fourth Hospital were included in this study. RT-PCR method was used to measure the level of 2019-nCov RNA in pharyngeal swab samples of these patients. The patients were divided into RNA positive and negative group, and the differences of clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were compared. Results: There were 31 RNA of 2019-nCov positive cases, and 23 negative cases. Common clinical symptoms of two groups were fever (80.64% vs. 86.96%) , chills (61.29% vs. 52.17%) , cough (80.64% vs. 95.65%) , fatigue (61.30% vs. 56.52%) , chest distress (77.42% vs.73.91%) . Some other symptoms were headache, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement. There was no statistically significant difference in other clinical characteristics except for dyspnea between two groups. Conclusions: RNA positive and negative NCP patients shared similar clinical symptoms, while RNA positive NCP patients tended to have dyspnea. Therefore, we should improve the understanding of NCP to prevent missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; In addition, more rapid and accurate NCP diagnostic approaches should be further developed."
Experimental characterization of speech aerosol dispersion dynamics.,"Contact and inhalation of virions-carrying human aerosols represent the primary transmission pathway for airborne diseases including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Relative to sneezing and coughing, non-symptomatic aerosol-producing activities such as speaking are highly understudied. The dispersions of aerosols from vocalization by a human subject are hereby quantified using high-speed particle image velocimetry. Syllables of different aerosol production rates were tested and compared to coughing. Results indicate aerosol productions and penetrations are not correlated. E.g. 'ti' and 'ma' have similar production rates but only 'ti' penetrated as far as coughs. All cases exhibited a rapidly penetrating ""jet phase"" followed by a slow ""puff phase."" Immediate dilution of aerosols was prevented by vortex ring flow structures that concentrated particles toward the plume-front. A high-fidelity assessment of risks to exposure must account for aerosol production rate, penetration, plume direction and the prevailing air current."
Indications for and contraindications of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with COVID-19 vaccination.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted over 1 year and will not disappear in a short time. There is no specific remedy against the virus as yet. Vaccination is thus far one of the most important strategies for preventing COVID-19. Cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher mortality because of immunosuppression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a novel anticancer strategy for blocking inhibitory pathways, which are related to the immune response. There is a question regarding whether COVID-19 vaccination and ICI treatment impact each other in cancer patients. This review explores both sides of the relationship between ICI treatment and COVID-19 vaccination and suggests good efficacy and safety of ICI treatment after COVID-19 vaccination as well as little impact on the virus protection and toxicity associated with COVID-19 vaccination during ICI treatment."
Tracking COVID-19 via sewage.,"Purpose of review: We discuss the potential role of the faecal chain in COVID-19 and highlight recent studies using waste water-based epidemiology (WBE) to track severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent findings: WBE has been suggested as an adjunct to improve disease surveillance and aid early detection of circulating disease. SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19, is an enveloped virus, and as such, typically not associated with the waste water environment, given high susceptibility to degradation in aqueous conditions. A review of the current literature supports the ability to detect of SARS-CoV-2 in waste water and suggests methods to predict community prevalence based on viral quantification. Summary: The summary of current practices shows that while the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 is possible from waste water, issues remain regarding the efficacy of virial concentration and subsequent quantification and alignment with epidemiological data."
Arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for patients with COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a source of significant morbidity and death worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed. Clinical trials have focused largely on direct antiviral therapies or on immunomodulation in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. One therapeutic approach that remains to be clinically investigated is disruption of the host-virus relationship through amino acid restriction, a strategy used successfully in the setting of cancer treatment. Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown in nonclinical studies to be essential in the life cycle of many viruses. Therefore, arginine depletion may be an effective therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Several arginine-metabolizing enzymes in clinical development may be a viable approach to induce a low arginine environment to treat COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Herein, we explore the rationale for arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19."
Point-of-Care PCR Assays for COVID-19 Detection.,"Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection. The distinct features of digital PCR and electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges. The potential of CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted. Commercial RT-PCR POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed."
Suitability of databases in the Asia-Pacific for collaborative monitoring of vaccine safety.,"Introduction: Information regarding availability of electronic healthcare databases in the Asia-Pacific region is critical for planning vaccine safety assessments particularly, as COVID-19 vaccines are introduced. This study aimed to identify data sources in the region, potentially suitable for vaccine safety surveillance. This manuscript is endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE). Methods: Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. Results: Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied, impacting on timeliness of data access. Conclusions: Variation in vaccine data availability, complexities in data access including, governance and data release approval procedures, together with requirement for data linkage for outcome information, all contribute to the challenges in building a distributed network for vaccine safety assessment in the Asia-Pacific and globally. Common data models (CDMs) may help expedite vaccine safety research across the region."
Synthetic proteins for COVID-19 diagnostics.,"There is an urgent need for inexpensive, rapid and specific antigen-based assays to test for vaccine efficacy and detect infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. We have identified a small, synthetic protein (JS7), representing a region of maximum variability within the receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds antibodies in sera from nine patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 of varying severity. Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD, as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides from the RBD interface with ACE2. Variants of JS7, such as E484K or N501Y, can be quickly synthesized in pure form in large quantities by automated methods. JS7 and related synthetic antigens can provide a basis for specific diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections."
[Diagnostic imaging findings in COVID-19].,"This is a review of diagnostic imaging findings in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CT findings are frequently bilateral, multilobar and peripheral ground-glass opacities with vascular enlargements. Consolidations often appear during progression as well as crazy paving and reticulation. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions and pneumothorax are rare and should raise concern for other disease. Initially the CT can be normal, and the diagnostic performance for COVID-19 is not optimal. However, findings of characteristic ground-glass opacities during the ongoing epidemic should lead to considerations, that the patient may have COVID-19."
Clinical Properties and Diagnostic Methods of COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancies: Meta-Analysis.,"We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published retrospective studies that examined data based on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by clinical symptoms, molecular (RT-PCR) diagnosis, and characteristic CT imaging features in pregnant women. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01/May/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug."
Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged in December 2019 when the first case was reported in Wuhan, China and turned into a pandemic with 27 million (September 9th) cases. Currently, there are over 95,000 complete genome sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, in public databases, accompanying a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about the viral population variation when the virus is evolving as it continues to spread. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics. We emphasize that little diversity is observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed to speed up diagnostics and vaccine design."
Maintaining Maternal-Newborn Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In addition to older individuals and those with underlying chronic health conditions, maternal and newborn populations were also identified as being at greater risk. It became critical for hospitals and clinicians to maintain the safety of individuals in the facility and minimize the transmission of COVID-19 while continuing to strive for optimized outcomes by providing family-centered care. Rapid change during the pandemic made it appropriate to use the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle to continually evaluate proposed and standard practices. Our team established an obstetric COVID-19 unit for women and newborns, developed guidelines for visitation and for the use of personal protective equipment, initiated universal COVID-19 testing, and provided health education to emphasize shared decision making."

Current understanding on molecular drug targets and emerging treatment strategy for novel coronavirus-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, contain crown-like spikes on its surface, exceptional of large RNA genome, and a special replication machinery. Common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 include cough, common cold, fever, sore throat, and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease (SARD) such as pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells, T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and also influences the production and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Repurposing of various drugs during this emergency condition can reduce the rate of mortality as well as time and cost. Two druggable protein and enzyme targets have been selected in this review article due to their crucial role in the viral life cycle. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4A), cyclophilin, nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) play significant role in early and late phase of SARS-CoV-2 replication and translation. This review paper is based on the rationale of inhibiting of various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and enzymes as novel therapeutic approaches for the management and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discussed the structural and functional relationship of different proteins and enzymes to develop therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."
Association of Health Status and Nicotine Consumption with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates.,"Background: Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or nicotine consumption is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. Methods: Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n = 8214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in either April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and nicotine and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco or nicotine with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. Results: Compared to people with self-identified ""excellent"" or very good health status, those reporting ""good"" or ""fair"" health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. Conclusions: In a statewide, community-based population drawn for SARS-CoV-2 testing, we find that overall health status was associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. More research is needed to further understand the nature of this relationship."
Two Patients With Severe COVID Pneumonia Treated With the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter.,We present 2 patients with rapidly escalating oxygen requirements from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19) treated with the Seraph100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter under Emergency Use Authorization from the US Federal Drug Administration. The Seraph100 is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion filter previously demonstrated to remove viral particles and pro-inflammatory cytokines from the blood. Treatment with the Seraph100 filter was associated with a rapid improvement in oxygenation and both patients were discharged from the hospital without supplemental oxygen.
Clearance and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with COVID-19.,"Patients with coronavirus disease-2019 may be discharged based on clinical resolution of symptoms, and evidence for viral RNA clearance from the upper respiratory tract. Understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral clearance profile is crucial to establish a re-testing plan on discharge and ending isolation of patients. We aimed to evaluate the number of days that a patient needed to achieve undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab and/or an oropharyngeal swab). The clearance and persistence of viral RNA was evaluated in two groups of positive patients: those who achieved two negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and those who kept testing positive. Patients were organized thereafter in two subgroups, mild illness patients discharged home and inpatients who had moderate to severe illness. Results from RT-PCR tests were then correlated with results from the evaluation of the immune response. The study evidenced that most patients tested positive for more than 2 weeks and that persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead."
"Standard Operating Procedure for Specimen Collection, Packaging and Transport for Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2.","Coronavirus disease-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2). Specimen quality, and proper transportation is vital for accurate diagnosis. This standard operating procedure is designed to educate the clinicians, nurses, paramedics, and laboratory personnel regarding proper methods of sample collection, packaging, and transportation. Nasopharyngeal swabs and/or oropharyngeal swabs should be collected for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect SARS-CoV-2. The sample should be collected wearing proper personal protective equipment, packed in a triple packaging system, and transported maintaining cold chain."
"My Experience with SARS-CoV-2, with a Focus on Testing.","Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) got off to a slow start in the United States. In this commentary, I describe my experience with CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a focus on being tested at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Respiratory Diagnostic Center on its inaugural day."
Coronaviruses - a new old menace.,"The current pandemic caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been described as a global health emergency. The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: what exactly is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible the novel coronavirus is? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for COVID-19? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, a comparative study of three pathogenic coronaviruses that primarily invade the human respiratory system and may cause death, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This review describes the source of origin, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spreading entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The novel coronavirus spreads faster than its two predecessors - the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV - but has lower fatality rate. The global impact of this new pandemic is still uncertain, but it is a challenge to healthcare systems around the world."
Evidence-Based Strategies for Clinical Organizations to Address COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy.,"The success of vaccination programs is contingent upon irrefutable scientific safety data combined with high rates of public acceptance and population coverage. Vaccine hesitancy, characterized by lack of confidence in vaccination and/or complacency about vaccination that may lead to delay or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of services, threatens to undermine the success of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs. The rapid pace of vaccine development, misinformation in popular and social media, the polarized sociopolitical environment, and the inherent complexities of large-scale vaccination efforts may undermine vaccination confidence and increase complacency about COVID-19 vaccination. Although the experience of recent lethal surges of COVID-19 infections has underscored the value of COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring population uptake of COVID-19 vaccination will require application of multilevel, evidence-based strategies to influence behavior change and address vaccine hesitancy. Recent survey research evaluating public attitudes in the United States toward the COVID-19 vaccine reveals substantial vaccine hesitancy. Building upon efforts at the policy and community level to ensure population access to COVID-19 vaccination, a strong health care system response is critical to address vaccine hesitancy. Drawing on the evidence base in social, behavioral, communication, and implementation science, we review, summarize, and encourage use of interpersonal, individual-level, and organizational interventions within clinical organizations to address this critical gap and improve population adoption of COVID-19 vaccination."
Brazilian Older People Hospitalized by COVID-19: Characteristics and Prognostic Factors in a Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Objective: Analyzing the survival of older people hospitalized due to COVID-19 in Brazil and identifying its main predictive factors for death. Method: This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, based on 20,831 records of hospitalizations of older people due to SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. The observation period was from February 28 to May 18, 2020. Results: There was a reduced overall survival time of 47.70% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [46.72%, 48.67%]) in 10 days. The variables age, race, education, intensive care unit (ICU), region, day of hospitalization, time elapsed between the first symptom and hospitalization, and the municipality that provided assistance showed increased risk of death using the multiple Cox proportional-hazards model. Conclusion: These results emphasize the relevance of inequality and access to health services as determinants for the death of older people with COVID-19."
Interim estimates in null models of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.,"Recently released interim numbers from advanced vaccine candidate clinical trials suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) of >90% is achievable. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are highly heterogeneous and exhibit localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, these characteristic bursts in SARS-CoV-2 infection may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with bursts that over longer periods converge to zero VE but that for interim periods frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of an RNA-based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 VE should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and reported cases."
"Doubling Time of the COVID-19 Epidemic by Province, China.","In China, the doubling time of the coronavirus disease epidemic by province increased during January 20-February 9, 2020. Doubling time estimates ranged from 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-2.0) days for Hunan Province to 3.1 (95% CI 2.1-4.8) days for Xinjiang Province. The estimate for Hubei Province was 2.5 (95% CI 2.4-2.6) days."
Single-dose BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine significantly boosts neutralizing antibody response in health care workers recovering from asymptomatic or mild natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Objectives: To measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titres in previously infected or uninfected health care workers who received one or two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: NtAbs were titrated as dose-inhibiting 50% virus replication (ID50) by live virus microneutralization. We evaluated 41 health care workers recovering from mild or asymptomatic infection at first vaccination dose (T1_inf) and 21 days later (T2_inf). Sixteen uninfected health care workers were evaluated 20 days after first dose (T2_uninf) and 20 days after second vaccine dose (T3_uninf). Results: At T2_inf, but not at T1_inf, there was a significant correlation between days from diagnosis (median 313, interquartile range 285-322) and NtAb levels (P = 0.011). NtAb titres increased at T2_inf with respect to T1_inf (1544 (732-2232) vs 26 (10-88), P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant increase in NtAb titres at T3_uninf compared with T2_uninf (183 (111-301) vs 5 (5-15), P < 0001). However, NtAb levels at T2_inf were significantly higher than those at T2_uninf and T3_uninf (P < 0.0001 for both analyses). Conclusions: A single vaccination in people with mild or asymptomatic previous infection further boosts SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity to levels higher than those obtained by complete two-vaccination in uninfected subjects."
Longitudinal observation of antibody responses for 14 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Better understanding of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection might provide valuable insights into the future implementation of vaccination policies. Longitudinal analysis of IgG antibody titers was carried out in 32 recovered COVID-19 patients based in the Umbria region of Italy for 14 months after Mild and Moderately-Severe infection.Two FDA-approved immunoassays against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (NCP) and anti-spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) were used for sequential serological tests at different time points. The demographics,clinical history and symptom profile associated with the magnitude and longevity of antibody responses were also analyzed. Anti-S-RBD IgG persisted in 96.8% (31 of 32) subjects at 14 months. Patients reporting loss of smell and taste during the clinical course of the disease developed significantly higher antibody titers. Anti-NCP IgG seronegative patients(n=7) at 10 months, tested positive for anti-S-RBD IgG at 12,13 and 14 months emphasizing on a higher false-negative rate for NCP protein-based antibody assays. This study also highlights the importance of adopting specific immunoassays for routine estimation of antibody titers and the decreased rate of re-infections in recovered patients."
Partial protection of Sinopharm vaccine against SARS COV2 during recent outbreak in Bahrain.,"Background: In order to impart immunity against SARS COV 2 in the community, the oil rich countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) provided citizens and expatriates with free vaccination. Different types of vaccination brands were utilized for this purpose. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the different types of vaccinations used. Methods: This is an observational analytical case study of one Bahraini family who were vaccinated with 1st, 2nd or no dose. Results: Out of 22 double dose recipients of SARS COV2 vaccine, 20 were infected. Those 20 were vaccinated against SARS COV 2 using Sinopharm, the rest (2) were in direct contact with the source but were vaccinated against SARS COV 2 using other type of vaccine. Out of 26 single dose recipients of Sinopharm vaccine, 23 were infected. The other three were not in direct contact with the infected source. Social gathering has been the main source of transmission. The infection has been mild with headache, chest pain. From 20 cases with double dose vaccinations only one had a lung infection and needed hospitalization. Out of 23 cases with single dose vaccinations 10 were hospitalized due to lung infections. All family members who were not vaccinated were infected, three were hospitalized one of which was deceased due to diabetes mellitus complications. Conlcusion: Sinopharm provides partial protection against SARS COV 2 infection. That might be due to lack of its potential to detect recent variations in the protein structure of spike(S) protein of virus."
Work Based Assessments (WBAs) amongst UK medical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic: How have we adapted?,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recently identified as the RNA virus resulting in the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This was following cases of pneumonia identified in Hubei Province in China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in medical, financial and social disruption on an international scale. Such disruption has additionally impacted postgraduate medical training. This has been reflected in the attainment of Work Based Assessments amongst medical trainees in the United Kingdom."
An in-silico evaluation of different Saikosaponins for their potency against SARS-CoV-2 using NSP15 and fusion spike glycoprotein as targets.,"The Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared the widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic emergency, which has resulted in 1,773,086 confirmed cases including 111,652 human deaths, as on 13 April 2020, as reported to World Health Organization. As of now, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs declared to be officially useful against the infection. Saikosaponin is a group of oleanane derivatives reported in Chinese medicinal plants and are described for their anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activities. They have also been known to have anti-coronaviral property by interfering the early stage of viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate the potency of different Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via computational molecular docking simulations. Docking was carried out on a Glide module of Schrodinger Maestro 2018-1 MM Share Version on NSP15 (PDB ID: 6W01) and Prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) from SARS-CoV-2. From the binding energy and interaction studies, the Saikosaponins U and V showed the best affinity towards both the proteins suggesting them to be future research molecule as they mark the desire interaction with NSP15, which is responsible for replication of RNA and also with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein which manage the connection with ACE2.

COVID-19 Vaccination Intent and Perceptions Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at similar rates as the general population, and there was initial concern regarding potential for severe illness.1-4 Vaccinations were authorized for emergency use in the United States in December 2020 and aim to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, there are concerns that people will be hesitant to receive the vaccine for a variety of reasons including insufficient data in certain populations including those with IBD. We surveyed patients with IBD to identify potential concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination."
Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of four different strategies for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the general population (CoV-Surv Study): study protocol for a two-factorial randomized controlled multi-arm trial with cluster sampling.,"Background: To achieve higher effectiveness in population-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and to reliably predict the course of an outbreak, screening, and monitoring of infected individuals without major symptoms (about 40% of the population) will be necessary. While current testing capacities are also used to identify such asymptomatic cases, this rather passive approach is not suitable in generating reliable population-based estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers to allow any dependable predictions on the course of the pandemic. Methods: This trial implements a two-factorial, randomized, controlled, multi-arm, prospective, interventional, single-blinded design with cluster sampling and four study arms, each representing a different SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance strategy based on individuals' self-collection of saliva samples which are then sent to and analyzed by a laboratory. The targeted sample size for the trial is 10,000 saliva samples equally allocated to the four study arms (2500 participants per arm). Strategies differ with respect to tested population groups (individuals vs. all household members) and testing approach (without vs. with pre-screening survey). The trial is complemented by an economic evaluation and qualitative assessment of user experiences. Primary outcomes include costs per completely screened person, costs per positive case, positive detection rate, and precision of positive detection rate. Discussion: Systems for active surveillance of the general population will gain more importance in the context of pandemics and related disease prevention efforts. The pandemic parameters derived from such active surveillance with routine population monitoring therefore not only enable a prospective assessment of the short-term course of a pandemic, but also a more targeted and thus more effective use of local and short-term countermeasures. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov DRKS00023271 . Registered November 30, 2020, with the German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien)."
Management of Neurosurgical Cases in a Tertiary Care Referral Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons from a Middle-Income Country.,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been at its peak for the past 8 months and has affected more than 215 countries around the world. India is now the second most-affected nation with more than 48,000,000 cases and 79,000 deaths. Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation, the number of deaths is almost one third that of the United States and one half that of Brazil. However, there has been no experience published from non-COVID-19-designated hospitals, where the aim is to manage noninfected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. Methods: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (nontrauma) done in the past 5 months (March-July 2020) in our institute, which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India, and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. Results: We operated a total of 630 cases (nontrauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (P = 0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared with the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of rapid antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into 3 zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone, and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. Conclusions: We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID-19-designated hospitals in high-volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Strict zoning targeted testing and effective triage can help in management during the pandemic."
Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Building Trust to Protect Nursing Home Staff and Residents.,"Vaccines are critical to protect both nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19, but some staff have expressed reservations about being vaccinated. In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare-one of the largest US long-term care providers-implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees' family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs."
Adding saliva testing to oropharyngeal and deep nasal swab testing increases PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in primary care and children.,"Objective: To compare the concordance and acceptability of saliva testing with standard-of-care oropharyngeal and bilateral deep nasal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and in general practice. Design: Prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study. Setting: Royal Children's Hospital, and two general practices (cohealth, West Melbourne; Cirqit Health, Altona North) in Melbourne, July-October 2020. Participants: 1050 people who provided paired saliva and oropharyngeal-nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: Numbers of cases in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either specimen type by real-time polymerase chain reaction; concordance of results for paired specimens; positive percent agreement (PPA) for virus detection, by specimen type. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 54 of 1050 people with assessable specimens (5%), including 19 cases (35%) in which both specimens were positive. The overall PPA was 72% (95% CI, 58-84%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 49-76%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. For the 35 positive specimens from people aged 10 years or more, PPA was 86% (95% CI, 70-95%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 45-79%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. Adding saliva testing to standard-of-care oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing increased overall case detection by 59% (95% CI, 29-95%). Providing saliva was preferred to an oropharyngeal-nasal swab by most participants (75%), including 141 of 153 children under 10 years of age (92%). Conclusion: In children over 10 years of age and adults, saliva testing alone may be suitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, while for children under 10, saliva testing may be suitable as an adjunct to oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing for increasing case detection."
[Update 2021: COVID-19 from the Perspective of Haematology and Haemostaseology].,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a profound influence on the hematopoetic system that mediates clinical symptoms and mortality. Several studies have shown that treatment of the cytokine storm (CRS) with anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone and tocilizumab can significantly improve survival. Systematic reviews confirm the safety of convalescent plasma administration and offer initial indications of its effectiveness in certain groups. COVID-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) represent severe infection- or vaccination associated complications that require a specific diagnostic and therapeutic workup.
Harnessing the power of novel animal-free test methods for the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.,"The COVID-19-inducing virus, SARS-CoV2, is likely to remain a threat to human health unless efficient drugs or vaccines become available. Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches."
Differential Tropism of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Bat Cells.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 did not replicate efficiently in 13 bat cell lines, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replicated efficiently in kidney cells of its ancestral host, the Rhinolophus sinicus bat, suggesting different evolutionary origins. Structural modeling showed that RBD/RsACE2 binding may contribute to the differential cellular tropism."
The Microbiology of Coronaviruses.,"The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening outcomes."
Challenges and opportunities for antiviral monoclonal antibodies as COVID-19 therapy.,"To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics. However, historical efforts to advance antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of other respiratory infections have been met with categorical failures in the clinic. By investigating the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses spread within the lung, along with available biodistribution data for systemically injected mAb, we highlight the challenges faced by current antiviral mAbs for COVID-19. We summarize some of the leading mAbs currently in development, and present the evidence supporting inhaled delivery of antiviral mAb as an early intervention against COVID-19 that could prevent important pulmonary morbidities associated with the infection."
Pregnant women's perspectives on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine.,"Background: Since coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines have been distributed, a debate has raised on whether pregnant women should get the vaccine. No available data exist so far regarding the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. Study design: A survey was made at the University of Naples Federico II and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome, on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes toward the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020) and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome (ref. #Ost4-2020). Results: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine during pregnancy (40 [28.2%] vs 102 [71.8%]). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99 [69.7%] vs 43 [30.3%]; chi-square test=24.187; P<.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128 [90.1%] vs 14 [9.9%]; chi-square test=6.091; P=.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75 [52.8%] vs 67 [47.2%]; chi-square test=10.996; P=.001). Conclusion: Urgent data are needed on the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counseling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty."
"Safety of emergency, elective and day case operating during the winter period at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust: lessons from the outcomes of 4,254 surgical patients from the first COVID-19 wave.","Background: There is limited evidence on perioperative outcomes of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to inform continued operating into the winter period. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the rate of 30-day COVID-19 transmission and mortality of all surgical patients in the three hospitals in our trust in the East of England during the first lockdown in March 2020. All patients who underwent a swab were swabbed on or 24 hours prior to admission. Results: There were 4,254 patients and an overall 30-day mortality of 0.99%. The excess surgical mortality in our region was 0.29%. There were 39 patients who were COVID-19 positive within 30 days of admission, 12 of whom died. All 12 were emergency admissions with a length of stay longer than 24 hours. There were three deaths among those who underwent day case surgery, one of whom was COVID-19 negative, and the other two were not swabbed but not suspected to have COVID-19. There were two COVID-19 positive elective cases and none in day case elective or emergency surgery. There were no COVID-19 positive deaths in elective or day case surgery. Conclusions: There was a low rate of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in elective and day case operations. Our data have allowed us to guide patients in the consent process and provided the evidence base to restart elective and day case operating with precautions and regular review. A number of regions will be similarly affected and should perform a review of their data for the winter period and beyond."
Antibody response and the clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 in Croatia: the importance of a two-step testing approach.,"According to anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroresponse in patients with COVID-19 from Croatia, we emphasised the issue of different serological tests and need for combining diagnostic methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISA and IgM/IgG immunochromatographic assay (ICA) were used for testing 60 sera from 21 patients (6 with severe, 10 moderate, and 5 with mild disease). The main clinical, demographic, and haemato-biochemical data were analysed. The most common symptoms were cough (95.2%), fever (90.5%), and fatigue and shortness of breath (42.9%). Pulmonary opacities showed 76.2% of patients. Within the first 7 days of illness, seropositivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 42.9% and 7.1%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 25% and 10.7%, respectively. From day 8 after onset, ELISA IgA and IgG seropositivity was 90.6% and 68.8%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 84.4% and 75%, respectively. In general, sensitivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 68.3% and 40%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 56.7% and 45.0%, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody distributions by each method were statistically different (ICA IgM vs. IgG, p = 0.016; ELISA IgG vs. IgA, p < 0.001). Antibody response in COVID-19 varies and depends on the time the serum is taken, on the severity of disease, and on the type of test used. IgM and IgA antibodies as early-stage disease markers are comparable, although they cannot replace each other. Simultaneous IgM/IgG/IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing followed by the confirmation of positive findings with another test in a two-tier testing is recommended."
"Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, Including B.1.1.28/P.1, British Columbia, Canada.","To screen all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive samples in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and determine whether they represented variants of concern, we implemented a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based algorithm. We rapidly identified 77 samples with variants: 57 with B.1.1.7, 7 with B.1.351, and an epidemiologic cluster of 13 with B.1.1.28/P.1."
Hybrid-COVID: a novel hybrid 2D/3D CNN based on cross-domain adaptation approach for COVID-19 screening from chest X-ray images.,"The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which first appeared at the end of December 2019, continues to spread rapidly in most countries of the world. Respiratory infections occur primarily in the majority of patients treated with COVID-19. In light of the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the need for diagnostic tools to identify COVID-19 infection at early stages is of vital importance. For decades, chest X-ray (CXR) technologies have proven their ability to accurately detect respiratory diseases. More recently, with the availability of COVID-19 CXR scans, deep learning algorithms have played a critical role in the healthcare arena by allowing radiologists to recognize COVID-19 patients from their CXR images. However, the majority of screening methods for COVID-19 reported in recent studies are based on 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although 3D CNNs are capable of capturing contextual information compared to their 2D counterparts, their use is limited due to their increased computational cost (i.e. requires much extra memory and much more computing power). In this study, a transfer learning-based hybrid 2D/3D CNN architecture for COVID-19 screening using CXRs has been developed. The proposed architecture consists of the incorporation of a pre-trained deep model (VGG16) and a shallow 3D CNN, combined with a depth-wise separable convolution layer and a spatial pyramid pooling module (SPP). Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution helps to preserve the useful features while reducing the computational burden of the model. The SPP module is designed to extract multi-level representations from intermediate ones. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve reasonable performances when evaluated on a collected dataset (3 classes to be predicted: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal). Notably, it achieved a sensitivity of 98.33%, a specificity of 98.68% and an overall accuracy of 96.91."
COVID-19 vaccines for patients with cancer: benefits likely outweigh risks.,"Less than a year since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ten vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for at least limited use, with over sixty others in clinical trials. This swift achievement has generated excitement and arrives at a time of great need, as the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to rapidly increase. Two vaccines are currently approved for full use, both built on mRNA and lipid nanotechnology platforms, a success story of mRNA technology 20 years in the making. For patients with cancer, questions arise around the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in the setting of immune alterations engendered by their malignancy and/or therapies. We summarize the current data on leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and vaccination of patients undergoing immunomodulatory cancer treatments. Most current cancer therapeutics should not prevent the generation of protective immunity. We call for more research in this area and recommend that the majority of patients with cancer receive COVID vaccinations when possible."
The race to treat COVID-19: Potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.,"The unforeseen emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the Wuhan province of China in December 2019, subsequently its abrupt spread across the world has severely affected human life. In a short span of time, COVID-19 has sacked more than one million human lives and marked as a severe global pandemic, which is drastically accountable for the adverse effect directly to the human society, particularly the health care system and the economy. The unavailability of approved and effective drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 further created conditions more adverse and terrifying. To win the war against this pandemic within time there is a desperate need for the most adequate therapeutic treatment, which can be achieved by the collaborative research work among scientists worldwide. In continuation of our efforts to support the scientific community, a review has been presented which discusses the structure and the activity of numerous molecules exhibiting promising SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs inhibition activities. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of the structure, a plausible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and crucial structural features substantial to inhibit the primary virus-based and host-based targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. We anticipate optimistically that this perspective will provide the reader and researcher's better understanding regarding COVID-19 and pave the path in the direction of COVID-19 drug discovery and development paradigm."
Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Care Workers After a Single Dose of mRNA-1273 Vaccine.,This cohort study of health care workers in a metropolitan Veterans Administration network examines the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection after receiving a single dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine compared with no vaccination.
Assessing COVID-19 vaccine literacy: a preliminary online survey.,"The COVID-19 infodemic can be countered by scientific evidence, clear and consistent communication, and improved health literacy of both individuals in need of information and those providing it. A rapid online survey was carried out to evaluate vaccine literacy (VL) skills in the general population and perceptions about COVID-19 vaccine candidates, along with behavior and beliefs about current vaccinations. Observed VL levels were consistent with previous observations - where comparable self-reported tools were administered face-to-face and by paper-and-pencil - the mean functional score being = 2.92, while the interactive-critical score was = 3.27, out of a maximum of 4. Perceptions regarding future COVID-19 vaccines, along with beliefs about vaccination, were mostly positive and significantly associated with functional and interactive-critical VL scales. Despite limitations, the study confirms that surveys via the web are a suitable method to evaluate and track attitudes during infectious disease outbreaks and assess health literacy skills about vaccination, which can be useful to adapt medical communication strategies, for a better understanding of the value of immunization."
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and acute liver injury after COVID-19 vaccine.,"A 26-year-old woman was sent to the emergency room by her primary care physician for a new petechial rash and thrombocytopenia 2 weeks after receiving the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Her hospital course was complicated by transaminitis. Her platelet count improved to normal on hospital day 5 after receiving intravenous steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin to treat her suspected diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Extensive workup for her thrombocytopenia and transaminitis was unremarkable including ruling out infectious, autoimmune and toxic causes. A liver biopsy was unrevealing and her transaminitis was improved on discharge. Although not proven, the temporal relationship of her vaccination with thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver enzymes points towards the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as the most likely inciting factor."
[Mass testing for Covid-19 : what can we learn from real-world implementation ?].,"While several modelling studies suggest mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 could be effective, real-world attempts at implementation have not been sufficient to evaluate its contribution to controlling the pandemic. To slow the spread of the virus, a mass-testing campaign would need frequent testing over a prolonged period with high rates of participation, all while maintaining public health measures. Screening seems more useful for targeted populations or high-risk events (businesses, teaching facilities, public or private institutions, sporting or cultural events). With their low cost and rapid results, rapid tests should be favored for these interventions."
[A surveillance system to detect COVID-19 infections in health care workers. Experience in 209 cases].,"Background: Healthcare personnel are a high-risk group for acquiring COVID-19 disease. They represent 4 to 20% of the total number of cases reported in different geographical areas. Aim: To describe an epidemiological surveillance strategy to detect symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early case detection among healthcare personnel at a university hospital. Patients and methods: We assessed 209 healthcare workers reporting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in a telephone counseling system. After a structured evaluation, the suggestions ranged from having a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR test, consulting in the emergency room or at outpatient clinic or returning to work. Results: In 61% of assessed workers a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was requested and 28 (22%) were positive. In a multivariate analysis, the clinical variables associated with a positive PCR test were the presence of fever, sudden loss of smell or taste, and a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive case. Conclusions: The telephone symptom monitoring program allowed the early detection of a significant number of healthcare officials with acute respiratory infection due to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it is easy to implement and has a low cost."
"A Timely Call to Arms: COVID-19, the Circadian Clock, and Critical Care.","We currently find ourselves in the midst of a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the highly infectious novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we discuss aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathology and how these might interact with the circadian clock of the host. We further focus on the severe manifestation of the illness, leading to hospitalization in an intensive care unit. The most common severe complications of COVID-19 relate to clock-regulated human physiology. We speculate on how the pandemic might be used to gain insights on the circadian clock but, more importantly, on how knowledge of the circadian clock might be used to mitigate the disease expression and the clinical course of COVID-19."
Facial nerve palsy following the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines: analysis of a self-reporting database.,"Objectives: Facial nerve palsy (or Bell's palsy) has occasionally been reported following the administration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). Our study investigated such cases using a large self-reporting database from the USA (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS]). Methods: A disproportionality analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was conducted for VAERS reports from individuals who were vaccinated at the age of 18 years or over, between January 2010 and April 2021. Results: The analysis revealed that the adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of facial nerve palsy, after administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, was significantly highly reported, both for BNT162b2 (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65-2.06) and mRNA-1273 (ROR 1.54; 95% CI 1.39-1.70). These levels were comparable to that following influenza vaccination reported before the COVID-19 pandemic (ROR 2.04; 95% CI 1.76-2.36). Conclusions: Our pharmacovigilance study results suggest that the incidence of facial nerve palsy as a non-serious AEFI may be lower than, or equivalent to, that for influenza vaccines. This information might be of value in the context of promoting worldwide vaccination, but needs to be validated in future observational studies."
Development of Wastewater Pooled Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Congregate Living Settings.,"Wastewater-based monitoring for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the individual building level could be an efficient, passive means of early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side by side to assess feasibility, performance, and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over 8 weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24-h composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living. IMPORTANCE Some of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious, with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate contagious, newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period."
The RADx(SM) Tech Process: Accelerating Innovation for COVID-19 Testing.,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic testing across populations quickly became evident. In response, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was determined not only to invest heavily in this area but to change the process by which grant proposals were reviewed and funded in order to spur faster development of viable technologies. The Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative was designed to speed innovation, commercialization, and implementation of potential COVID-19 diagnostic technology. As part of this effort, the RADx Tech initiative focuses on the development, validation, and commercialization of innovative point-of-care, home-based, and clinical lab-based tests that can detect SARS-CoV-2. This effort was enabled through the NIH's National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) Point-of-Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN)."
Genetic comparison among various coronavirus strains for the identification of potential vaccine targets of SARS-CoV2.,"On-going pandemic pneumonia outbreak COVID-19 has raised an urgent public health issue worldwide impacting millions of people with a continuous increase in both morbidity and mortality. The causative agent of this disease is identified and named as SARS-CoV2 because of its genetic relatedness to SARS-CoV species that was responsible for the 2003 coronavirus outbreak. The immense spread of the disease in a very small period demands urgent development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infected patients. A plethora of research is being conducted globally on this novel coronavirus strain to gain knowledge about its origin, evolutionary history, and phylogeny. This review is an effort to compare genetic similarities and diversifications among coronavirus strains, which can hint towards the susceptible antigen targets of SARS-CoV2 to come up with the potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the prevention of this public threat."
The Role of Trauma in Mothers' COVID-19 Vaccine Beliefs and Intentions.,"Objective: Research on COVID-19 vaccine beliefs has focused primarily on adults' intentions to vaccinate themselves; however, many parents will also face decisions about vaccinating their children. In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. Methods: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. Results: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. Conclusion: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging."
Biological characteristics and biomarkers of novel SARS-CoV-2 facilitated rapid development and implementation of diagnostic tools and surveillance measures.,"Existing coronavirus named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has speeded its spread across the globe immediately after emergence in China, Wuhan region, at the end of the year 2019. Different techniques, including genome sequencing, structural feature classification by electron microscopy, and chest imaging using computed tomography, are primarily used to diagnose and screen SARS-CoV-2 suspected individuals. Determination of the viral structure, surface proteins, and genome sequence has provided a design blueprint for the diagnostic investigations of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and rapidly emerging diagnostic technologies, vaccine trials, and cell-entry-inhibiting drugs. Here, we describe recent understandings on the spike glycoprotein (S protein), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and their receptor complex. This report also aims to review recently established diagnostic technologies and developments in surveillance measures for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the characteristics and performance of emerging techniques. Smartphone apps for contact tracing can help nations to conduct surveillance measures before a vaccine and effective medicines become available. We also describe promising point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies that are under consideration by researchers for advancement beyond the proof-of-concept stage. Developing novel diagnostic techniques needs to be facilitated to establish automatic systems, without any personal involvement or arrangement to curb an existing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic crisis, and could also be appropriate for avoiding the emergence of a future epidemic crisis."
"Immunity, endothelial injury and complement-induced coagulopathy in COVID-19.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China. This pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a pathogenic condition that has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached pandemic proportions. As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases. In the early stages of the disease, most patients experience mild clinical symptoms, including a high fever and dry cough. However, 20% of patients rapidly progress to severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Almost 10% of these critically ill patients subsequently die. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression are emerging and highlight the critical role of the immunological hyper-response - characterized by widespread endothelial damage, complement-induced blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy - in disease exacerbation. These insights may aid the identification of new or existing therapeutic interventions to limit the progression of early disease and treat severe cases."
Review of Current Advances in Serologic Testing for COVID-19.,"Objectives: To examine and summarize the current literature on serologic methods for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: A literature review was performed using searches in databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Thirty-two peer-reviewed papers and 23 preprints were examined. Results: The studies included lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, and neutralizing antibody assays. The use of all major SARS-CoV-2 antigens was demonstrated to have diagnostic value. Assays measuring total antibody reactivity had the highest sensitivity. In addition, all the methods provided opportunities to characterize the humoral immune response by isotype. The combined use of IgM and IgG detection resulted in a higher sensitivity than that observed when detecting either isotype alone. Although IgA was rarely studied, it was also demonstrated to be a sensitive marker of infection, and levels correlated with disease severity and neutralizing activity. Conclusions: The use of serologic testing, in conjunction with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, was demonstrated to significantly increase the sensitivity of detection of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether antibody titers correlated with clinical severity. However, preliminary investigations indicated some immunoassays may be a surrogate for the prediction of neutralizing antibody titers and the selection of recovered patients for convalescent serum donation."
Hesitation and Refusal Factors in Individuals' Decision-Making Processes Regarding a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination.,"Introduction: Considering the global prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a vaccine is being developed to control the disease as a complementary solution to hygiene measures-and better, in social terms, than social distancing. Given that a vaccine will eventually be produced, information will be needed to support a potential campaign to promote vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the variables affecting the likelihood of refusal and indecision toward a vaccine against COVID-19 and to determine the acceptance of the vaccine for different scenarios of effectiveness and side effects. Materials and Methods: A multinomial logistic regression method based on the Health Belief Model was used to estimate the current methodology, using data obtained by an online anonymous survey of 370 respondents in Chile. Results: The results indicate that 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided or 77% of individuals who would potentially be willing to be inoculated. The main variables that explained the probability of rejection or indecision were associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as, the side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine; perceived benefits, including immunity, decreased fear of contagion, and the protection of oneself and the environment; action signals, such as, responses from ones' family and the government, available information, and specialists' recommendations; and susceptibility, including the contagion rate per 1,000 inhabitants and relatives with COVID-19, among others. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness. Additionally, the variables that explained the indecision toward or rejection of a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be used in designing public health policies. Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate specific, differentiated vaccination-promotion strategies for the anti-vaccine and undecided groups based on the factors that explain the probability of individuals refusing or expressing hesitation toward vaccination."
Molecular diagnostic assays for COVID-19: an overview.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the cardinal importance of rapid and accurate diagnostic assays. Since the early days of the outbreak, researchers with different scientific backgrounds across the globe have tried to fulfill the urgent need for such assays, with many assays having been approved and with others still undergoing clinical validation. Molecular diagnostic assays are a major group of tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Currently, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used method. Other diagnostic molecular methods, including CRISPR-based assays, isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, digital PCR, microarray assays, and next generation sequencing (NGS), are promising alternatives. In this review, we summarize the technical and clinical applications of the different COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assays and suggest directions for the implementation of such technologies in future infectious disease outbreaks."
Clinical testing for COVID-19.,"As the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 caused coronavirus disease 2019 cases in the United States, the initial test was developed and performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As the number of cases increased, the demand for tests multiplied, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on RT-PCR were developed, each with different techniques, specifications, and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need and so it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here, we review the timeline of test development, the turnaround times, and the various approved tests, and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests. We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting."
An Outbreak of Covid-19 on an Aircraft Carrier.,"Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurred on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a crew of 4779 personnel. Methods: We obtained clinical and demographic data for all crew members, including results of testing by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms. Results: The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and 1 died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms."
Beyond the new normal: Assessing the feasibility of vaccine-based suppression of SARS-CoV-2.,"As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into its second year, there is hope on the horizon, in the form of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which promise disease suppression and a return to pre-pandemic normalcy. In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously."
Point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 serological assays for enhanced case finding in a UK inpatient population.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. Case identification is currently made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the acute phase and largely restricted to healthcare laboratories. Serological assays are emerging but independent validation is urgently required to assess their utility. We evaluated five different point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kits against PCR, finding concordance across the assays (n = 15). We subsequently tested 200 patients using the OrientGene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and find a sensitivity of 74% in the early infection period (day 5-9 post symptom onset), with 100% sensitivity not seen until day 13, demonstrating inferiority to PCR testing in the infectious period. Negative rate was 96%, but in validating the serological tests uncovered potential false-negatives from PCR testing late-presenting cases. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 37% in the general population precludes any use for general screening. Where a case definition is applied however, the PPV is substantially improved (95.4%), supporting use of serology testing in carefully targeted, high-risk populations. Larger studies in specific patient cohorts, including those with mild infection are urgently required to inform on the applicability of POC serological assays to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and improve case finding of patients that may experience late complications."
Fatal disseminated aspergillosis in an immunocompetent patient with COVID-19 due to Aspergillus ochraceus.,"Aspergillus infection is a well-known complication of severe influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and these infections have been related with significant morbidity and mortality even when appropriately diagnosed and treated. Recent studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might increase the risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Here, we report the first case of Aspergillus ochraceus in a SARS-CoV-2 positive immunocompetent patient, which is complicated by pulmonary and brain infections. Proven IPA is supported by the positive Galactomannan test, culture-positive, and histopathological evidence. The patient did not respond to voriconazole, and liposomal amphotericin B was added to his anti-fungal regimen. Further studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence of IPA in immunocompetent patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, testing for the incidence of Aspergillus species in lower respiratory secretions and Galactomannan test of COVID-19 patients with appropriate therapy and targeted anti-fungal therapy based on the primary clinical suspicion of IPA are highly recommended."
"Scientific misinformation: A perfect storm, missteps, and moving forward.","The spread of scientific misinformation is not new but rather has long posed threats to human health, environmental well-being, and the creation of a sustainable and equitable future. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to develop strategies to counteract scientific misinformation has taken on an acute urgency. Cell editor Nicole Neuman sat down with Walter Quattrociocchi and Dietram Scheufele to gain insights on how we got here and what does-and does not-work to fight the spread of scientific misinformation. Excerpts from this conversation, edited for clarity and length, are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online."
Dynamic and features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Gabon.,"In a context where SARS-CoV-2 population-wide testing is implemented, clinical features and antibody response in those infected have never been documented in Africa. Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and lymphocytopenia (20-40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low. The high rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies observed in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative contact cases suggests that subclinical infection may have been overlooked in our setting."
"Absence of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission from Children in Isolation to Guardians, South Korea.","We explored transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among 12 children and their uninfected guardians in hospital isolation rooms in South Korea. We found that, even with close frequent contact, guardians who used appropriate personal protective equipment were not infected by children with diagnosed coronavirus disease."
Living with respiratory viruses: The next saga in human/viral coexistence?,Testing for respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in clinical and epidemiological settings has contrasting purposes and utility. Symptomatic patients are best tested with respiratory virus panels to establish the pathogen and guide personalized treatment. Asymptomatic patients are tested for a single infectious pathogen to establish carrier status and guide containment.
Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera.,"The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant."
Vaccine design based on 16 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently requires an effective vaccine for prevention. In this study, 66 epitopes containing pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the IEDB database were compared with the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 66 potentially immune-related peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained. Based on the single-nucleotide polymorphisms analysis of spike protein of 1218 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, 52 easily mutated sites were identified and used for vaccine epitope screening. The best vaccine candidate epitopes in the 66 peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were screened out through mutation and immunoinformatics analysis. The best candidate epitopes were connected by different linkers in silico to obtain vaccine candidate sequences. The results showed that 16 epitopes were relatively conservative, immunological, nontoxic, and nonallergenic, could induce the secretion of cytokines, and were more likely to be exposed on the surface of the spike protein. They were both B- and T-cell epitopes, and could recognize a certain number of HLA molecules and had high coverage rates in different populations. Moreover, epitopes 897-913 were predicted to have possible cross-immunoprotection for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The results of vaccine candidate sequences screening suggested that sequences (without linker, with linker GGGSGGG, EAAAK, GPGPG, and KK, respectively) were the best. The proteins translated by these sequences were relatively stable, with a high antigenic index and good biological activity. Our study provided vaccine candidate epitopes and sequences for the research of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
Combined SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing and respiratory virus panel RT-PCR on the Hologic Panther Fusion system.,"Background: Significant overlap exists between the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. This poses a serious challenge to clinical diagnosis, laboratory testing, and infection control programs. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion Respiratory Assays (RA) compared to the GenMark ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and to assess the ability of the Panther Fusion to perform parallel testing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses from a single sample. Study design: A diagnostic comparison study was carried out using 375 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89). Forty additional viruses in 30 specimens were detected by Fusion that were not detected by ePlex. The maximum specimen throughput for parallel testing of the Fusion Respiratory Assays with SARS-CoV-2 was 275 samples in 20.7 h for Fusion SARS-CoV-2 and 350 samples in 20.0 h for Aptima Transcription Mediated Amplification SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Fusion RA demonstrated substantial agreement compared to the ePlex RPP. However, the Fusion detected respiratory viruses not identified by ePlex, consistent with higher clinical sensitivity. Workflows for parallel testing of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate that the Panther Fusion instrument provides a flexible, moderate to high throughput testing option for pandemic and seasonal respiratory viruses."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): a Systemic Infection.,"To date, seven identified coronaviruses (CoVs) have been found to infect humans; of these, three highly pathogenic variants have emerged in the 21st century. The newest member of this group, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected at the end of 2019 in Hubei province, China. Since then, this novel coronavirus has spread worldwide, causing a pandemic; the respiratory disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to mild respiratory tract infections and influenza-like illness to severe disease with accompanying lung injury, multiorgan failure, and death. Although the lungs are believed to be the site at which SARS-CoV-2 replicates, infected patients often report other symptoms, suggesting the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, heart, cardiovascular system, kidneys, and other organs; therefore, the following question arises: is COVID-19 a respiratory or systemic disease? This review aims to summarize existing data on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues in both patients and ex vivo models."
Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age. Because the impact of immunosuppression on disease severity is not entirely clear, management of patients under immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial. Six cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive medication are presented. The aim of this study was to describe patients' clinical manifestation and chronologic development of virus-specific antibodies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection before and after restart with immunosuppressive/biological therapy as an indicator for a specific immune response. All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients. Late antibody development seems to be more frequent in older patients and in patients with combined immunosuppressive treatment. In this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could be useful prior to restarting immunosuppressive therapy."
Therapeutic options in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnant patient.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has resulted in the development of various therapeutics to treat and prevent major complications related to the virus; pregnant patients are vulnerable to acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 because of frequent contact with the healthcare setting. Despite the publication of a plethora of case series and randomized control trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapeutics, few have addressed treatment in the pregnant population. To date, there has been no published review of therapeutic options in the treatment of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Here, we provide a review of available treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, various trials with inclusion and exclusion of the pregnant patients, and potential side effects of each treatment in the pregnant patient."
[Interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis in imported COVID-19 cases and factors contributing to delayed diagnosis in Guangdong Province].,"Objective: To understand the distribution patterns and the factors influencing the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis in imported COVID-19 cases in Guangdong Province to provide evidence for formulating and implementing effective control measures. Methods: We collected the data of imported COVID-19 cases from March 1st to April 10th, 2020 published on the official websites of Health Commission of Guangdong Province and local government of the cities in Guangdong Province for epidemiological analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the distribution patterns of the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis of the imported cases, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing the interval. Results: A total of 179 imported cases were reported in Guangdong by April 10th, 2020. The average interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis was 4.21 days with a median of 2 days. The interval was between 1 and 3 days in 69.8% of the cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a negative result of the initial nucleic acid test (OR=5.205, 95% CI: 1.100-24.640, P=0.038) and interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis &gt;2 days (OR=85.654, 95%CI: 24.569-298.615, P &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for the finding delay. Conclusions: The results of initial nucleic acid detection and the interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 are the major contributing factors of delayed case detection. This finding suggests that strict quarantine and detection measures should be carried out for the personnel entering China to accurately and quickly identify the cases."
"A study of ethnic, gender and educational differences in attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Israel - implications for vaccination implementation policies.","Background: Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently available for the public in Israel. The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. Aim: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). Results: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. Conclusions: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns."
Laboratory diagnosis for Covid-19: A mini-review.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2. This disease was first identified in December 2019 and rapidly developed into a challenge to the public health systems around the world. In the absence of a vaccine and specific therapies, disease control and promotion of patient health are strongly dependent on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. This review describes the main laboratory approaches to making a diagnosis of COVID-19 and identifying those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
"Comparison of Immune Response between SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 Infection, Perspective on Vaccine Design and Development.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are the three epidemiological diseases caused by the Coronaviridae family. Perceiving the immune responses in these infections and the escape of viruses could help us design drugs and vaccines for confronting these infections. This review investigates the innate and adaptive immune responses reported in the infections of the three coronaviruses SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Moreover, the present study can trigger researchers to design and develop new vaccines and drugs based on immune system responses. In conclusion, due to the need for an effective and efficient immune stimulation against coronavirus, a combination of several strategies seems necessary for developing the vaccine."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Saliva as Compared to Nasopharyngeal Swabs in Outpatients.,"Widely available and easily accessible testing for COVID-19 is a cornerstone of pandemic containment strategies. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the currently accepted standard for sample collection but are limited by their need for collection devices and sampling by trained healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to NPS in an outpatient setting. This was a prospective study conducted at three centers, which compared the performance of saliva and NPS samples collected at the time of assessment center visit. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sensitivity and overall agreement determined between saliva and NPS. Clinical data was abstracted by chart review for select study participants. Of the 432 paired samples, 46 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with seven discordant observed between the two sample types (four individuals testing positive only by NPS and three by saliva only). The observed agreement was 98.4% (kappa coefficient 0.91) and a composite reference standard demonstrated sensitivity of 0.91 and 0.93 for saliva and NPS samples, respectively. On average, the Ct values obtained from saliva as compared to NPS were higher by 2.76. This study demonstrates that saliva performs comparably to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva was simple to collect, did not require transport media, and could be tested with equipment readily available at most laboratories. The use of saliva as an acceptable alternative to NPS could support the use of widespread surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2."
"SARS-CoV-2 serology in 4000 health care and administrative staff across seven sites in Lombardy, Italy.","Lombardy is the Italian region most affected by COVID-19. We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4% vs 13.5%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure."
"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR.","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA. Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits."
"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Mitigation Efforts among Office Workers, Washington, DC, USA.","Despite mitigation efforts, 2 coronavirus disease outbreaks were identified among office workers in Washington, DC. Moderate adherence to workplace mitigation efforts was reported in a serologic survey; activities outside of the workplace were associated with infection. Adherence to safety measures are critical for returning to work during the pandemic."
"An ultra-portable, self-contained point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection.","There is currently a high level of demand for rapid COVID-19 tests, that can detect the onset of the disease at point of care settings. We have developed an ultra-portable, self-contained, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection, based on the principle of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP assay is 100% sensitive and specific to detect a minimum of 300 RNA copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2. All of the required sample transportation, lysing and amplification steps are performed in a standalone disposable cartridge, which is controlled by a battery operated, pocket size (6x9x4cm3) unit. The test is easy to operate and does not require skilled personnel. The total time from sample to answer is approximately 35 min; a colorimetric readout indicates positive or negative results. This portable diagnostic platform has significant potential for rapid and effective testing in community settings. This will accelerate clinical decision making, in terms of effective triage and timely therapeutic and infection control interventions."
Fulminant H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections with a 4-year interval without an identifiable underlying cause: a case report.,"Background: The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is highly variable from asymptomatic infection to fulminant disease. The reasons for the variation are only starting to unravel, with risk factors including age and certain comorbidities as well as genetic defects causing immunological perturbations in the interferon pathways. Case presentation: We report the case of an otherwise healthy Caucasian man, who at ages 60 and 64 years suffered from severe H1N1 influenza virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections, respectively. In both cases, there were acute kidney impairment and the need for intensive care unit admission as well as mechanical ventilation. Fortunately, after both infections there was full clinical recovery. The severity of the infections indicates an underlying impairment in the ability to control these kinds of infections. Challenge of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed impaired type I and III antiviral interferon responses and reduced interferon-stimulated gene expression. However, despite investigation of patient samples by whole exome sequencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, no known disease-causing genetic variants related to interferon pathways were found, nor were interferon autoantibodies demonstrated. Thus, any underlying immunological cause of this unusual susceptibility to severe viral infections remains unresolved. Conclusion: The patient experienced very similar severe clinical pictures triggered by H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections, indicating an underlying inability to contain these infections. We were unable to show that the patient had any of the currently known types of immune incompetence but identified genetic changes possibly contributing to the severe course of both infections. Further analyses to delineate contribution factors are needed."
"Diagnostic yield, safety, and advantages of ultra-low dose chest CT compared to chest radiography in early stage suspected SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: A retrospective observational study.","To determine the role of ultra-low dose chest computed tomography (uld CT) compared to chest radiographs in patients with laboratory-confirmed early stage SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.Chest radiographs and uld CT of 12 consecutive suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients performed up to 48 hours from hospital admission were reviewed by 2 radiologists. Dosimetry and descriptive statistics of both modalities were analyzed.On uld CT, parenchymal abnormalities compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were detected in 10/12 (83%) patients whereas on chest X-ray in, respectively, 8/12 (66%) and 5/12 (41%) patients for reader 1 and 2. The average increment of diagnostic performance of uld CT compared to chest X-ray was 29%. The average effective dose was, respectively, of 0.219 and 0.073 mSv.Uld CT detects substantially more lung injuries in symptomatic patients with suspected early stage SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to chest radiographs, with a significantly better inter-reader agreement, at the cost of a slightly higher equivalent radiation dose."
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is vulnerable to moderate electric fields.,"Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapies and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main target. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2. Here we show, with the help of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2, undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor. We also show that these severe structural changes upon electric-field application also occur in the mutant RBDs corresponding to the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Remarkably, while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus without further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be suitable for application to other mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and in general to membrane proteins of other virus types."
New Brazilian variant of the SARS-CoV-2 (P1/Gamma) of COVID-19 in Alagoas state.,"Since the beginning of 2020, health authorities have been monitoring the cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has grown every day in Brazil and around the world, becoming pandemic. The new coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2 by scientists spreads rapidly, causing fear, deaths, and threats for the economy of several countries. This work aimed to describe the clinical characterization of the first cases of a new Brazilian variant of SARS-CoV-2 (P1) in the State of Alagoas, which occurred on February 16th, 2021. Two cases are described: first, a person infected in Amazonas State, where the new variant P1 was first described, who migrated to Alagoas State, and second, a case of probable community transmission within Alagoas, since the patient had no history of recent travel. In both confirmed cases the symptoms were mild. Further studies are necessary to better understand the clinical behavior of P1 SARS-CoV-2 variant and also the associated sequelae in the context of COVID-19."
Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"There have recently been safety concerns regarding an increased risk of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) following administration of SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral vector vaccines. The Southern African Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis reviewed the emerging literature on this idiosyncratic complication. A draft document was produced and revised by consensus agreement by a panel of professionals from various specialties. The recommendations were adjudicated by independent international experts to avoid local bias. We present concise, practical guidelines for the clinical management of VITT."
Evolution of COVID-19 Guidelines for University of Washington Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Patient Care.,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus, in late December 2019 has placed an overwhelming strain on healthcare institutions nationwide. The modern healthcare system has never managed a pandemic of this magnitude, the ramifications of which will undoubtedly lead to lasting changes in policy and protocol development for viral testing guidelines, personal protective equipment (PPE), surgical scheduling, and residency education and training. The State of Washington had the first reported case and death related to COVID-19 in the United States. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons have a unique risk of exposure to SC2 and developing COVID-19 because of our proximity of working in and around the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The present report has summarized the evolution of COVID-19 guidelines in 4 key areas: 1) preoperative SC2 testing; 2) PPE stewardship; 3) surgical scheduling guidelines; and 4) resident education and training for oral and maxillofacial surgery at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."
COVID-19: Significance of antibodies.,"The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused pandemic Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Considering the serious medical, economic and social consequences of this pandemic and the lack of definite medication and vaccine it is necessary to describe natural immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 in order to exploit them for treating the patients and monitoring the general population. Moreover, detecting the most immunogenic antigens of the virus is fundamental for designing effective vaccines. Antibodies being valuable for diagnostic therapeutic and protective purposes are suitable to be addressed in this context. Herein, we have summarized the findings of serological investigations and the outcomes of neutralizing antibodies administration in COVID-19 patients."
Antiviral Activity of Nanomaterials against Coronaviruses.,"One of the challenges facing by world nowadays is the generation of new pathogens that cause public health issues. Coronavirus (CoV) is one of the severe pathogens that possess the RNA (ribonucleic acid) envelop, and extensively infect humans, birds, and other mammals. The novel strain ""SARS-CoV-2"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) causes deadly infection all over the world and presents a pandemic situation nowadays. The SARS-CoV-2 has 40 different strains that create a worrying situation for health authorities. The virus develops serious pneumonia in infected persons and causes severe damage to the lungs. There is no vaccine available for this virus up to present. To cure this type of infections by making vaccines and antiviral drugs is still a major challenge for researchers. Nanotechnology covering a multidisciplinary field may find the solution to this lethal infection. The interaction of nanomaterials and microorganisms is considered as a potential treatment method because the nanomaterials owe unique physicochemical properties. The aim of this review is to present an overview of previous and recent studies of nanomaterials against coronaviruses and to provide possible new strategies for upcoming research using the nanotechnology platform."
"COVID-19 vaccination in patients with diabetes mellitus: Current concepts, uncertainties and challenges.","Background and aims: To summarize the available evidence on the use COVID-19 vaccines in patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: We performed a thorough literature search with regard to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tends to portend a poor prognosis in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Primary prevention remains the mainstay for mitigating the risks associated with COVID-19 in patients with DM. A significant step in primary prevention is timely vaccination. Routine vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B is recommended in patients with DM with good efficacy and reasonable safety profile. With clinical data supporting a robust neutralizing antibody response in COVID-19 patients with DM, vaccination in individuals with DM is justified. In fact, as the burden of the disease is borne by people with DM, COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized in individuals with DM. Multiple unresolved issues with regard to preferred vaccine type, vaccine efficacy and durability, frequency of administration, vaccination in children (<18 years) and pregnant/lactating women however remain, and need to be addressed through future research. Conclusions: Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of poor prognosis with COVID-19 and vaccination should be prioritized in them. However, many unresolved issues with regard to COVID-19 vaccination need to be addressed through future research."
Testing vaccines in the time of Covid: The changing landscape.,"The initial trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were randomised control trials (RCT) with a placebo as control. The use of a placebo was ethically justified because, as with any new and emerging infectious disease, there was no known vaccine. There are now at least eight vaccines that have been shown to be effective and approved for emergency use, so the use of a placebo in the control group is no longer ethically justified. This article discusses why ethical guidelines should be continually evaluated in a changing landscape and why trust is so important."
[Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was used to diagnose two cases of 2019-nCoV infection].,"The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs. One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV. Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients. The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
Comparison of Four Molecular In Vitro Diagnostic Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Specimens.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first discovered in December 2019 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly nonspecific, and symptoms overlap those of other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population. Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19-positive patients. In the present study, we evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of the following four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted emergency use authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (modified CDC) assay, the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular) assay, GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 (GenMark) assay, and the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 (Hologic) assay. This information is crucial for both laboratories and clinical teams as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made."
Neutralizing and cross-reacting antibodies: implications for immunotherapy and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in 2019 and quickly spread globally, causing a pandemic. There is an urgent need to develop vaccines against the virus, and both convalescent plasma and immune globulin are currently in clinical trials for treatment of patients with COVID-19. It is unclear whether antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 have neutralizing capacity and whether they can protect from future infection. Seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been circulating for decades. It is currently unknown whether antibodies against seasonal HCoV may cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Data from neonates suggest that trans-placental antibodies against HCoV may have neutralizing capacity. Here we briefly review the epidemiologic observations on HCoV and discuss the potential implications for neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."
"Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity of 3D8, a Nucleic Acid-Hydrolyzing Single-Chain Variable Fragment (scFv), Targeting SARS-CoV-2 and Multiple Coronaviruses In Vitro.","The virus behind the current pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the etiology of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and poses a critical public health threat worldwide. Effective therapeutics and vaccines against multiple coronaviruses remain unavailable. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv), a recombinant antibody, exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses owing to its nucleic acid-hydrolyzing property. The antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses was evaluated in Vero E6 cell cultures. Viral growth was quantified with quantitative RT-qPCR and plaque assay. The nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 was assessed through abzyme assays of in vitro viral transcripts and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. We found that 3D8 inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Our results revealed the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Immunoblot and plaque assays showed the reduction of coronavirus nucleoproteins and infectious particles, respectively, in 3D8 scFv-treated cells. These data demonstrate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of 3D8 against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Thus, it could be considered a potential antiviral countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 and zoonotic coronaviruses."
Same pandemic but different studies: an exploration of COVID-19 research at the early stage.,"Objective: Scientific research is an essential necessity for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Accelerated paper-sharing makes it possible to explore the responses of scientific communities of different countries and their research focus. This is achieved by examining relevant publications during the early stage of the pandemic. This paper explores a timely research assessment on COVID-19 among China, USA, and EU. Materials and methods: Papers indexed in PubMed and published from December 30, 2019, to March 11, 2020, were selected. Papers from China, USA, and EU were assessed by calculating the significance of items in the co-occurrence exported from VOSviewer. Results: The results showed that Chinese studies focus more on clinical manifestations, while USA and EU focus on experimental research. Furthermore, US research is more geared toward detection techniques and mathematical models, China focuses more on monitoring the epidemic situation, and EU engages in both. Conclusions: This paper argues that the above distinctions are caused by differences in the stages of epidemic development, researchers' experience bases for formulating measures, traditions within the different medical cultures, and the distinction between ""information"" and ""knowledge""."
Network-Based Analysis of Fatal Comorbidities of COVID-19 and Potential Therapeutics.,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The case-fatality rate is significantly higher in older patients and those with diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular disorders. The human proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and basigin (BSG), are involved in high-confidence host-pathogen interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We considered these three proteins as seed nodes and applied the random walk with restart method on the human interactome to construct a protein-protein interaction sub-network, which captures the effects of viral invasion. We found that 'Insulin resistance', 'AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications' and 'adipocytokine signaling' were the common pathways associated with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The association of these critical pathways with aging and its related diseases explains the molecular basis of COVID-19 fatality. We further identified drugs that have effects on these proteins/pathways based on gene expression studies. We particularly focused on drugs that significantly downregulate ACE2 along with other critical proteins identified by the network-based approach. Among them, COL-3 had earlier shown activity against acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress, while entinostat and mocetinostat have been investigated for non-small-cell lung cancer. We propose that these drugs can be repurposed for COVID-19."
Novel application of automated machine learning with MALDI-TOF-MS for rapid high-throughput screening of COVID-19: a proof of concept.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unsustainable need for molecular diagnostic testing. Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted ""gold standard"", molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively. Machine learning enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS for COVID-19 testing exhibited performance comparable to existing commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests."
"A review of nasopharyngeal swab and saliva tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection: Disease timelines, relative sensitivities, and test optimization.","Testing is an essential part of containment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. This review summarizes studies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and testing. Nasopharyngeal samples are best at sensitivity detection, especially in early stages of disease and in asymptomatic individuals. Current swab processing involves a 100- to 1000-fold dilution of the patient sample. Future optimization of testing should focus on using smaller volumes of viral transport media and swab designs to increase comfort and increased viral adhesion."
"Severe, Symptomatic Reinfection in a Patient with COVID-19.","To date, there have only been a few reports of reinfections in COVID-19 patients. The possibility of being reinfected with COVID-19 is poorly understood. In this case report, we describe an individual who was initially diagnosed in April 2020 with COVID-19. Seven months later, he presented again to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have COVID-19 reinfection. We also summarize a list of all known cases of COVID-19 reinfection at this time."
Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of nine commercial RT-PCR kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia.,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to the design and development of multiple reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction kits aimed to facilitate the rapid scale-up of molecular testing for massive screening. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of nine commercial kits, which showed optimal performance and high discriminatory power. However, we observed differences in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and E gene Ct Values and discuss these results in light of the influence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability and its potential impact in current molecular diagnostic assays."
Homelessness and COVID-19: Leaving No One Behind.,"The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promotes the ""Leaving no one behind"" principle and sets goals in areas of critical importance. This principle has become extraordinarily important during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is especially relevant for fragile populations, such as people experiencing homelessness. Homeless persons live in congregate and poor hygiene settings that may favor virus transmission, often have underling physical and mental comorbidities that place them at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19, and have limited access to public healthcare and social services. In addition, the homeless are often overlooked by safety and health monitoring actions. All of these factors, taken together, place homeless persons at high risk of being left behind. It is therefore of utmost importance to put in place adequate public health measures to limit spread of infection among homeless persons, rapidly identify and isolate asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic subjects, promptly and appropriately treat positive cases, and correctly handle the entire socioeconomic environment of vulnerable people."
Inferring the ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 using phylogeographic analyses of Rhinolophus species.,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in four bat species: Rhinolophus acuminatus, Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus malayanus, and Rhinolophus shameli. Here, we analysed 343 sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) from georeferenced bats of the four Rhinolophus species identified as reservoirs of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Haplotype networks were constructed in order to investigate patterns of genetic diversity among bat populations of Southeast Asia and China. No strong geographic structure was found for the four Rhinolophus species, suggesting high dispersal capacity. The ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was predicted using the four localities in which bat viruses were recently discovered and the localities where bats showed the same CO1 haplotypes than virus-positive bats. The ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV was deduced from the localities where bat viruses were previously detected. The results show that the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV2 includes several regions of mainland Southeast Asia whereas the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV is mainly restricted to China. In agreement with these results, human populations in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand appear to be much less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries of Southeast Asia. In the climatic transitional zone between the two ecological niches (southern Yunnan, northern Laos, northern Vietnam), genomic recombination between highly divergent viruses is more likely to occur. Considering the limited data and the risk of recombinant bat-CoVs emergence as the source of new pandemics in humans, the bat populations in these regions should be under surveillance."
Comparison of antigen- and RT-PCR-based testing strategies for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in two high-exposure settings.,"Surveillance testing for infectious disease is an important tool to combat disease transmission at the population level. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when performed to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly."
Assessing the spreading potential of an undetected case of COVID-19 in orthopaedic surgery.,"Background: With the novel coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19), there is the fear of nosocomial infections and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions to healthcare workers (HCW). We report the case of a 64-year-old male patient who underwent explantation of a shoulder prosthesis due to a periprosthetic infection. He was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 7 days after admission to the orthopaedic department following strict infection control measures, routinely including screening all patients for multi-drug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization upon admission. Aim of our study is to report on the spreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare setting if standard contact precautions and infection control measures have been established. Methods: All HCW with exposure to the patient from day of admission until confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified and underwent oropharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Sixty-six HCW were identified: nine orthopaedic surgeons, four anaesthesiologists, 25 orthopaedic nurses, five nurse anesthetists, eight scrub nurses, five nursing students, two medical assistants and seven service employees. Fourteen HCW (21%) showed clinical symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection: cough (n = 4), sore throat (n = 3), nasal congestion (n = 3), dyspnea (n = 2), fever (n = 1), headache and myalgia (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 66 HCW. Conclusion: Hygienic measures and contact precautions, aimed at preventing the spread of MRDO, may have helped to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCW-despite high-risk exposure during intubation, surgical treatment and general care. Level of evidence: IV, case series."
Clinical and laboratory findings and PCR results in severe and non-severe COVID19 patients based on CURB-65 and WHO severity indices.,"Background: The importance of clinicolaboratory characteristics of COVID-19 made us report our findings in the Alborz province according to the latest National Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients and inpatients (trial five versions, 25 March 2020) of Iran by emphasizing rRT-PCR results, clinical features, comorbidities, and other laboratory findings in patients according to the severity of the disease. Methods: In this study, 202 patients were included, primarily of whom 164 had fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This cross-sectional, two-center study that involved 164 symptomatic adults hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 5 and April 5, 2020, was performed to analyze the frequency of rRT-PCR results, distribution of comorbidities, and initial clinicolaboratory data in severe and non-severe cases, comparing the compatibility of two methods for categorizing the severity of the disease. Results: According to our findings, 111 patients were rRT-PCR positive (67.6%), and 53 were rRT-PCR negative (32.4%), indicating no significant difference between severity groups that were not related to the date of symptoms' onset before admission. Based on the National Guideline, among vital signs and symptoms, mean oxygen saturation and frequency of nausea showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed in comorbidities. In CURB-65 groups, among vital signs and comorbidities, mean oxygen saturation, diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic heart disease (CHD), and asthma showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was seen in symptoms. Conclusion: In this study, rRT-PCR results of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were not related to severity categories. From initial clinical characteristics, decreased oxygen saturation appears to be a more common abnormality in severe and non-severe categories. National Guideline indices seem to be more comprehensive to categorize patients in severity groups than CURB-65, and there was compatibility just in non-severe groups of National Guideline and CURB-65 categories."
Rationale for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 screening in patients undergoing in-laboratory sleep studies.,Serra L. Rationale for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 screening in patients undergoing in-laboratory sleep studies. J Clin Sleep Med. 2021;17(6):1333.
Pooling Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens to Increase Testing Capacity for SARS-CoV-2.,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Current diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in upper and lower respiratory specimens. While sensitive and specific, these RT-PCR assays require considerable supplies and reagents, which are often limited during global pandemics and surge testing. Here, we show that a nasopharyngeal swab pooling strategy can detect a single positive sample in pools of up to 10 samples without sacrificing RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity. We also report that this pooling strategy can be applied to rapid, moderate complexity assays, such as the BioFire COVID-19 test. Implementing a pooling strategy can significantly increase laboratory testing capacity while simultaneously reducing turnaround times for rapid identification and isolation of positive COVID-19 cases in high risk populations."
SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease outcomes in non-human primate models: advances and implications.,"SARS-CoV-2 has been the causative pathogen of the pandemic of COVID-19, resulting in catastrophic health issues globally. It is important to develop human-like animal models for investigating the mechanisms that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect humans and cause COVID-19. Several studies demonstrated that the non-human primate (NHP) is permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection to cause typical clinical symptoms including fever, cough, breathing difficulty, and other diagnostic abnormalities such as immunopathogenesis and hyperplastic lesions in the lung. These NHP models have been used for investigating the potential infection route and host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as testing vaccines and drugs. This review aims to summarize the benefits and caveats of NHP models currently available for SARS-CoV-2, and to discuss key topics including model optimization, extended application, and clinical translation."
A role for quercetin in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Several months ago, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was detected in Wuhan City (China) and the aetiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated by the Chinese authorities as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The WHO announced this new disease was to be known as ""COVID-19."" When looking for new antiviral compounds, knowledge of the main viral proteins is fundamental. The major druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 include 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike (S) protein. Quercetin inhibits 3CLpro and PLpro with a docking binding energy corresponding to -6.25 and -4.62 kcal/mol, respectively. Quercetin has a theoretical, but significant, capability to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication, with the results showing this to be the fifth best compound out of 18 candidates. On the basis of the clinical COVID-19 manifestations, the multifaceted aspect of quercetin as both antiinflammatory and thrombin-inhibitory actions, should be taken into consideration."
"Comparative transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to identify potential pathways for drug repurposing.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has already caused in excess of 1.25 million deaths worldwide, and the number is increasing. Knowledge of the host transcriptional response against this virus and how the pathways are activated or suppressed compared to other human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that caused outbreaks previously can help in the identification of potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses. Based on these findings, a drug repurposing analysis was performed to identify potential drug candidates for combating COVID-19."
Rapid Implementation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Emergency Use Authorization RT-PCR Testing and Experience at an Academic Medical Institution.,"An epidemic caused by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in December 2019 has since rapidly spread internationally, requiring urgent response from the clinical diagnostics community. We present a detailed overview of the clinical validation and implementation of the first laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR test offered in the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital system following the Emergency Use Authorization issued by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens (n = 174) were validated using newly designed dual-target real-time RT-PCR (altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Reagent) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract specimens. Accuracy testing demonstrated excellent assay agreement between expected and observed values and comparable diagnostic performance to reference tests. The limit of detection was 2.7 and 23.0 gene copies per reaction for nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, respectively. Retrospective analysis of 1694 upper respiratory tract specimens from 1571 patients revealed increased positivity in older patients and males compared with females, and an increasing positivity rate from approximately 20% at the start of testing to 50% at the end of testing 3 weeks later. Herein, we demonstrate that the assay accurately and sensitively identifies SARS-CoV-2 in multiple specimen types in the clinical setting and summarize clinical data from early in the epidemic in New York City."
Overlap of immunotherapy-related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia: diagnostic and vaccine considerations.,"The clinically indistinguishable overlap between pneumonitis caused due to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and pneumonia associated with COVID-19 has posed considerable challenges for patients with cancer and oncologists alike. The cancer community continues to face the challenges that lay at the complex immunological intersection of immune-based cancer therapy and immune dysregulation that results from COVID-19. Is there compounded immune dysregulation that could lead to poor outcomes? Could ICIs, in fact, ameliorate SARS-CoV-2-driven T-cell exhaustion?A little more is known about the kinetics of the viral replication in immunocompromised patients now as compared with earlier during the pandemic. Working knowledge of the diagnostic and therapeutic nuances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with active cancers, issues related to viability and replication potential of the virus, unclear role of corticosteroids among those with diminished or dysfunctional effector T-cell repertoire, and the type of immunotherapy with differential risk of pneumonitis will inform decision making related to immunotherapy choices and decision for ICI continuation in the era of COVID-19."
Egypt's COVID-19 Recent Happenings and Perspectives: A Mini-Review.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected countries across the world. While the zoonotic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation, bats and pangolins are currently cited as the animal origin of the virus. Several types of vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed and are being used in vaccination drives across the world. A number of countries are experiencing second and third waves of the pandemic, which have claimed nearly four million lives out of the 180 million people infected globally as of June 2021. The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutants are posing high public health concerns owing to their rapid transmissibility, higher severity, and in some cases, ability to infect vaccinated people (vaccine breakthrough). Here in this mini-review, we specifically looked at the efforts and actions of the Egyptian government to slow down and control the spread of COVID-19. We also review the COVID-19 statistics in Egypt and the possible reasons behind the low prevalence and high case fatality rate (CFR%), comparing Egypt COVID-19 statistics with China (the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic) and the USA, Brazil, India, Italy, and France (the first countries in which the numbers of patients infected with COVID-19). Additionally, we have summarized the SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccines used in Egypt, and the use of medicinal plants as preventive and curative options."
SARS-CoV-2 presence in seminal fluid: Myth or reality.,"Great concerns have been raised on SARS-CoV-2 impact on men's andrological well-being, and one of the critically unanswered questions is whether it is present or not in the seminal fluid of infected subjects. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testis and in the male genital tract allows speculations about a possible testicular involvement during the infection, possibly mediated by local and/or systemic inflammation that might allow a high viral load to overcome the hemato-testicular barrier. To date, few investigations have been carried out to ascertain the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the seminal fluid with contrasting results. Furthermore, the cumulative number of subjects is far too low to answer the question unambiguously. Therefore, great caution is still needed when evaluating this data; otherwise, we risk unleashing unmotivated concerns in the scientific world with troublesome consequences in reproductive medicine."
A Nonadaptive Combinatorial Group Testing Strategy to Facilitate Health Care Worker Screening during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak.,"Routine testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care workers (HCWs) is critical. Group testing strategies to increase capacity facilitate mass population testing but do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a nonadaptive combinatorial (NAC) group testing strategy to increase throughput while facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350, and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1% to 10%. NAC matrices were compared versus Dorfman sequential (DS) group testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels, with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n = 700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. This methodology may allow laboratories to adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy."
"Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in different biologic matrix, their diagnostic validity and clinical relevance: A systematic review.","Due to COVID 19 outbreak many studies are being conducted for therapeutic strategies and vaccines but detection methods play an important role in the containment of the disease. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the molecular detection techniques in COVID-19. For framing the systematic review 6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies and articles were screened for relevant content till 25th April 2020. Observations from this systematic review reveal the utility of RT-PCR with serological testing as one such method cannot correlate with accurate results. Availability of point of care devices do not conform to sensitivity and specificity in comparison to the conventional methods due to lack of clinical investigations. Pivotal aim of molecular and serological research is the development of detection methods that can support the clinical decision making of patients suspected with SARS-CoV-2. However, none of the methods were 100% sensitive and specific; hence additional studies are required to overcome the challenges addressed here. We hope that the present article with its observations and suggestions will assist the researchers to realize this vision in future."
"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and Infection Fatality Ratio, Orleans and Jefferson Parishes, Louisiana, USA, May 2020.","Using a novel recruitment method and paired molecular and antibody testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we determined seroprevalence in a racially diverse municipality in Louisiana, USA. Infections were highly variable by ZIP code and differed by race/ethnicity. Overall census-weighted seroprevalence was 6.9%, and the calculated infection fatality ratio was 1.63%."
Factors affecting duration of SARS-Cov-2 viral shedding in mildly symptomatic patients isolated in a community facility.,"Introduction: Mildly symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in previously-well individuals form the majority of infections and also serve as potent vectors of transmission. The factors affecting the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral shedding (DVS) in these patients remain largely unknown. Objectives: To perform a systematic analysis of the clinical, radiologic, laboratory investigations in patients with few comorbidities infected with mild Covid-19 to identify factors associated with the DVS. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 were included. Baseline characteristics including age, nationality, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and type of isolation arrangement in the facility (single or in pairs) were collected. Clinical features and radiologic/haematologic findings were also collected. Taking day 28 as the cut-off, 187 patients who had a negative swab result up to day 28 (no prolonged DVS) were compared to 126 patients with a persistently positive result on or after day 28 (prolonged DVS). Results: Of 964 consecutive patients included, 851 (88.3%) patients were symptomatic. 266 patients had a documented negative RT-PCR assay with a median DVS of 25 days (range: 13 to 96 days; interquartile range (IQR): 22 to 33 days). Patients isolated in pairs were associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.7 to 4.5; p<0.0001) compared to those isolated individually. Among vital signs, only tachycardia was associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.0 to 7.1; p = 0.03). Amongst investigations, only a raised CRP was associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.8; p = 0.02). Conclusions: In young, mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients, prolonged DVS was associated with being isolated in pairs compared to individually. In situations where a negative RT-PCR test result is required, retesting in patients who were not isolated individually, or who had baseline tachycardia or a raised CRP, may be delayed to increase the yield of a negative result."
Prioritizing the marginalized in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.,"A recent correspondence pointed out that indigenous people and other ethnic communities should be included in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Indigenous communities carry a unique set of cultural beliefs and traditions that need to be preserved. This paper suggests that, aside from indigenous people, other marginalized sectors should also be included in the vaccine rollout by the government."
Short-term experiences of a liver transplant centre before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background/aim: With the COVID-19 pandemic, managing the process of solid organ transplantation has become a significant matter for transplant centres. In this study, we report our experiences on evaluating the effects of COVID-19 in patients with recent liver transplants. Materials and methods: We evaluated patients who received liver transplants during three close consecutive periods of time. For transplants conducted between October 1 and December 31, 2019, January 1 and March 10, 2020 and March 11 and June 22, 2020, the lung tomographies of patients were inspected for radiological signs of viral pneumonia. For patients after March 11, 2020, the hospital's electronic database system was scanned for preoperative and postoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing from Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of the respiratory tract samples. Results: A total of 149 patients over the age of 18 who received liver transplants at our centre between October 1, 2019 and June 22, 2020 were evaluated. During this time span, our centre conducted liver transplants on patients from 34 different provinces and also abroad. Within this time period, a total of nine patients had respiratory samples with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. PCR of respiratory tract samples was performed in 21 (14%) patients to identify the other potential infective agents in the respiratory tracts; Rhinovirus and Influenza A were detected in two and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in one patient. During the transplant periods, 99 (67.1%) patients were evaluated with computed tomography (CT). The CT findings of 18 (12%) patients were consistent with viral pneumonia. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups only in terms of air bronchogram findings (P = .012). Conclusion: The clinical status of our short-term liver transplant patients was far better than we originally anticipated, but it remains obvious that the necessary precautions should continue to be taken."
What's yours is ours: waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines.,"This paper gives an ethical argument for temporarily waiving intellectual property (IP) protections for COVID-19 vaccines. It examines two proposals under discussion at the World Trade Organization (WTO): the India/South Africa proposal and the WTO Director General proposal. Section I explains the background leading up to the WTO debate. Section II rebuts ethical arguments for retaining current IP protections, which appeal to benefiting society by spurring innovation and protecting rightful ownership. It sets forth positive ethical arguments for a temporary waiver that appeal to standing in solidarity and holding companies accountable. After examining built-in exceptions to existing agreements and finding them inadequate, the paper replies to objections to a temporary waiver and concludes, in section III, that the ethical argument for temporarily waiving IP protection for COVID-19 vaccines is strong."
COVID-2019 among dentists in the United States: A 6-month longitudinal report of accumulative prevalence and incidence.,"Background: In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the America Dental Association released COVID-19 infection control interim guidance for US dentists, advising the use of optimal personal protection equipment during aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the cumulative prevalence and incidence rates of COVID-19 among dentists and to assess their level of engagement in specific infection control practices. Methods: US dentists were invited to participate in a monthly web-based survey from June through November 2020. Approximately one-third of initial respondents (n = 785) participated in all 6 surveys, and they were asked about COVID-19 testing received, symptoms experienced, and infection prevention procedures followed in their primary practice. Results: Over a 6-month period, the cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence rate was 2.6%, representing 57 dentists who ever received a diagnosis of COVID-19. The incidence rates ranged from 0.2% through 1.1% each month. The proportion of dentists tested for COVID-19 increased over time, as did the rate of dentists performing aerosol-generating procedures. Enhanced infection prevention and control strategies in the dental practice were reported by nearly every participant monthly, and rates of personal protection equipment optimization, such as changing masks after each patient, dropped over time. Conclusions: US dentists continue to show a high level of adherence to enhanced infection control procedures in response to the ongoing pandemic, resulting in low rates of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19. Dentists are showing adherence to a strict protocol for enhanced infection control, which should help protect their patients, their dental team members, and themselves. Practical implications: COVID-19 infections among practicing dentists will likely remain low if dentists continue to adhere to guidance."
Impact of US vaccination strategy on COVID-19 wave dynamics.,"We employ the epidemic Renormalization Group (eRG) framework to understand, reproduce and predict the COVID-19 pandemic diffusion across the US. The human mobility across different geographical US divisions is modelled via open source flight data alongside the impact of social distancing for each such division. We analyse the impact of the vaccination strategy on the current pandemic wave dynamics in the US. We observe that the ongoing vaccination campaign will not impact the current pandemic wave and therefore strict social distancing measures must still be enacted. To curb the current and the next waves our results indisputably show that vaccinations alone are not enough and strict social distancing measures are required until sufficient immunity is achieved. Our results are essential for a successful vaccination strategy in the US."
COVID-19 vaccine-associated immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT): Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for a new syndrome.,"Very rare cases of thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia have occurred following the vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The aim of this concise review is to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiologic and pathogenic mechanisms of this syndrome named vaccine-associated immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT). A practical patient management section will also be dealt with using information available from national and international scientific societies as well as expert panels. A literature search on the VITT syndrome was carried out in PubMed using appropriate MeSH headings. Overall, 40 VITT cases have been reported. Continuous pharmacovigilance monitoring is needed to collect more data on the real incidence and the pathogenesis of VITT syndrome. Such information will also help us to optimize the management this rare but often clinically severe thrombotic condition associated with COVID-19 vaccination."
Diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every corner of the globe, causing societal instability. The resultant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to fever, sore throat, cough, chest and muscle pain, dyspnoea, confusion, anosmia, ageusia and headache. These can progress to life-threatening respiratory insufficiency, also affecting the heart, kidney, liver and nervous systems. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is often confused with that of influenza and seasonal upper respiratory tract viral infections. Due to available treatment strategies and required containments, rapid diagnosis is mandated. This Review brings clarity to the rapidly growing body of available and in-development diagnostic tests, including nanomaterial-based tools. It serves as a resource guide for scientists, physicians, students and the public at large."
False positive results in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapid antigen tests for inpatients.,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) test kits are widely used as primary screening test in Japan because rapid diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for infection control. We report cases with RAD test false-positive results in a ward for patients with disabilities. RAD tests potentially evoke hospital operational risk. It is desirable that performing PCR test appropriately when patients admitted to a medical treatment ward with COVID-19 symptoms instead of RAD test.
Adverse cardiovascular magnetic resonance phenotypes are associated with greater likelihood of incident coronavirus disease 2019: findings from the UK Biobank.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects older people. Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute COVID-19. However, these findings may reflect pre-existing cardiac phenotypes. Aims: We tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes with incident COVID-19. Methods: We studied UK Biobank participants with CMR imaging and COVID-19 testing. We considered left and right ventricular (LV, RV) volumes, ejection fractions, and stroke volumes, LV mass, LV strain, native T1, aortic distensibility, and arterial stiffness index. COVID-19 test results were obtained from Public Health England. Co-morbidities were ascertained from self-report and hospital episode statistics (HES). Critical care admission and death were from HES and death register records. We investigated the association of each cardiovascular measure with COVID-19 test result in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and prior myocardial infarction. Results: We studied 310 participants (n = 70 positive). Median age was 63.8 [57.5, 72.1] years; 51.0% (n = 158) were male. 78.7% (n = 244) were tested in hospital, 3.5% (n = 11) required critical care admission, and 6.1% (n = 19) died. In fully adjusted models, smaller LV/RV end-diastolic volumes, smaller LV stroke volume, and poorer global longitudinal strain were associated with significantly higher odds of COVID-19 positivity. Discussion: We demonstrate association of pre-existing adverse CMR phenotypes with greater odds of COVID-19 positivity independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: Observational reports of cardiovascular involvement after COVID-19 may, at least partly, reflect pre-existing cardiac status rather than COVID-19 induced alterations."
COVID-19 vaccine: where are we now and where should we go?,"Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently caused the pandemic with a high progressive speed and has been considered as the global public health crisis in 2020. This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter. Areas covered: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine. Expert opinion: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy."
The Potential Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from Patients with Negative RT-PCR Swab Tests to Others: Two Related Clusters of COVID-19 Outbreak.,"In December 2019, a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The false-negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 caused delayed diagnosis of COVID-19, which hindered the prevention and control of the pandemic. The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases has rarely been addressed previously. This study evaluated two clusters of COVID-19 in six patients, four of whom (66.7%) tested negative for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. All epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. The first cluster was a nosocomial infection of four health care providers in early January. One case resulted in a sequential familial cluster of infection. All patients either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG- and/or IgM-positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the recovery stage. Our study provides a cautionary warning that negative results for nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers. Serologic detection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM is an important test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
Immunoinformatic based identification of cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes from the Indian isolate of SARS-CoV-2.,"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has turned into a pandemic with about thirty million confirmed cases worldwide as of September 2020. Being an airborne infection, it can be catastrophic to populous countries like India. This study sets to identify potential cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolate which can act as an effective vaccine epitope candidate for the majority of the Indian population. The immunogenicity and the foreignness of the epitopes towards the human body have to be studied to further confirm their candidacy. The top-scoring epitopes were subjected to molecular docking studies to study their interactions with the corresponding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. The CTL epitopes were observed to bind at the peptide-binding groove of the corresponding HLA system, indicating their potency as an epitope candidate. The candidacy was further analyzed using sequence conservation studies and molecular dynamics simulation. The identified epitopes can be subjected to further studies for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
An updated review of the association of host genetic factors with susceptibility and resistance to COVID-19.,"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human populations sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to preliminary data, about 14% of cases are considered severe and 5% of cases result in critical illness and, reported case fatality rates vary from 1% to more than 7%. However, the symptoms of the disease and the clinical outcome are very different in infected people. In view of these differences, it is clearly apparent that to gain insight into the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, it is important to study not just the infectious particle in itself but also to investigate the virus-host cell interactions that occur during infection. This review seeks to consider the various aspects of genetic factors in determining the susceptibility and host resistance to SARS-CoV-2 throughout the recently published literature."
Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Response among COVID-19 Patients Receiving Favipiravir.,"We retrospectively studied nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who were hospitalized between January 13 and April 1, 2020. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. All patients were classified in the following groups: Group 1: received favipiravir + chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, Group 2: received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, and Group 3: no antiviral medication. Among the 115 patients, 38 (33%), 54 (47%), and 23 (20%) were in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median (IQR) baseline viral loads on day 0 of Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 7.2 (6.0-8.1), 6.9 (5.8-7.8), and 6.9 (5.8-7.6) log10 copies/mL, respectively. The reductions of mean viral loads on day 3 from baseline were 2.41, 1.38, and 2.19 log10 copies/mL in the corresponding groups (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the reduction of mean viral loads from baseline among the three groups on days 5 and 10 (P > 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that receiving favipiravir was associated with nasopharyngeal viral load reduction at three days (P = 0.001). Significant nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction was achieved in COVID-19 patients who received a favipiravir-containing regimen."
A deep dive into testing and management of COVID-19 for Australian high performance and professional sport.,"The purpose of testing for any communicable disease is to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of individual patients and to describe transmission dynamics. The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health officials to utilise the most comprehensive, accurate and timely information available to manage the rapidly evolving COVID-19 environment. High performance sport is a unique context that may look towards comprehensive testing as a means of risk mitigation. Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks. Finally, a review of the available technology that could be considered for use by medical staff at the point of care (PoC) in a high-performance sporting context is included."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 infection: A review of the clinical-pathological correlations of Coronavirus disease-19 in children.,"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020. This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications. The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days. It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum. This article gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation and laboratory tests of COVID-19 and correlating with the current understanding of the pathological basis of this disease in the paediatric population."
The risk of over-diagnosis in serological testing. Implications for communications strategies.,"Background: since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of developing a serological test has emerged and a debate on test accuracy and reliability become an issue widely discussed in the media. The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. Objectives: to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. Methods: the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. Results: at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. Conclusions: the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions."
Clinical characteristics and diagnostic challenges of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background/purpose: Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare. The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. Methods: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Results: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing."
Inadequate Minority Representation within SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Trials.,"Minority communities have borne the brunt of COVID-19 disease in the United States. Nonwhites have contracted most of the SARS-CoV-2 infections; COVID-19 mortality rates for Black Americans are more than twice those for whites. Given this, studying the most effective ways to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 in these populations should be a research priority, particularly with respect to vaccine trials. Federal guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration emphasize the need for inclusion of minority groups in these trials, but none of the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial protocols requires representative sampling of minorities. This piece emphasizes the importance of adequate inclusion of minority communities in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials, and the implications of this inclusion for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution."
Resource-efficient internally controlled in-house real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the most important contributions to COVID-19 crisis management. With the publication of the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2, several diagnostic PCR assays have been developed and published. In addition to in-house assays the market was flooded with numerous commercially available ready-to-use PCR kits, with both approaches showing alarming shortages in reagent supply. Aim: Here we present a resource-efficient in-house protocol for the PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient specimens (RKI/ZBS1 SARS-CoV-2 protocol). Methods: Two duplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assays are run simultaneously and provide information on two different SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions. Each one is duplexed with a control that either indicates potential PCR inhibition or proves the successful extraction of nucleic acid from the clinical specimen. Results: Limit of RNA detection for both SARS-CoV-2 assays is below 10 genomes per reaction. The protocol enables testing specimens in duplicate across the two different SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays, saving reagents by increasing testing capacity. The protocol can be run on various PCR cyclers with several PCR master mix kits. Conclusion: The presented RKI/ZBS1 SARS-CoV-2 protocol represents a cost-effective alternative in times of shortages when commercially available ready-to-use kits may not be available or affordable."
"A Gapless, Unambiguous RNA Metagenome-Assembled Genome Sequence of a Unique SARS-CoV-2 Variant Encoding Spike S813I and ORF1a A859V Substitutions.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented pandemic, threatening planetary health, society, and economy. Genomic surveillance continues to be a critical effort toward tracking the virus and containing its spread, and more genomes from diverse geographical areas and different time points are needed to provide an appropriate representation of the virus evolution. In this study, we report the successful assembly of one single gapless, unambiguous contiguous sequence representing the complete viral genome from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected health care worker in Cairo, Egypt. The sequence has all typical features of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with no protein-disrupting mutations. However, three mutations are worth highlighting and future tracking: a synonymous mutation causing a rare spike S813I variation and two less frequent ones leading to an A41V variation in NSP3, encoded by ORF1a (ORF1a A895V), and a Q677H variation in the spike protein. Both affected proteins, S and NSP3, are relevant to vaccine and drug development. Although the genome, named CU_S3, belongs to the prevalent global genotype, marked by the D614G spike variation, the combined variations in the spike proteins and ORF1a do not co-occur in any of the 197,000 genomes reported to date. Future studies will assess the biological, pathogenic, and epidemiological implications of this set of genetic variations. This line of research is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic innovation to stem the COVID-19 pandemic."
"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 9 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEDT 29 March 2020).","This is the ninth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 23:59 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 29 March 2020. It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence."
Novel coronavirus seropositivity and related factors among healthcare workers at a university hospital during the prevaccination period: a cross-sectional study.,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the specific risk factors for the transmission of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers in different campuses of a university hospital and to reveal the risk factors for antibody positivity. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 2988 (82%) of 3620 healthcare workers in a university hospital participated. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody was investigated using serum from healthcare workers who underwent COVID-19 antibody testing. The antibody test results of the participants were evaluated based on their work campus, their profession and their workplace. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05 in all analyses. Results: Of the participants in this study, 108 (3.6%) were antibody positive, and 2880 (96.4%) were negative. Antibody positivity rates were greater in nurses compared with other healthcare workers (p < 0.001). Regarding workplace, antibody positivity was greater in those working in intensive care compared to those working in other locations (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthcare workers are at the highest risk of being infected with COVID-19. Those who have a higher risk of infection among healthcare workers and those working in high-risk areas should be vaccinated early and use personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Trial registration: Retrospective permission was obtained from both the local ethics committee and the Turkish Ministry of Health for this study (IRB No:71522473/050.01.04/370, Date: 05.20.2020)."
Estimating the reproductive number R(0) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and eight European countries and implications for vaccination.,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from a regional outbreak to a global pandemic in just a few months. Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules."
The use of convalescent plasma for pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2: A systematic literature review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe illness leading to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. With this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature and ongoing clinical trials on convalescent plasma therapy in pediatric patients with COVID-19. The electronic databases Medline PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science were searched. Also, clinical trials registries were searched for potentially eligible studies. A total of 90 records were retrieved after duplicate removal. Eight studies were case reports of children treated with convalescent plasma therapy (14 children, age range, 9 weeks to 18 years); 5 children had a chronic disease. During the hospital stay, 5 received drugs (e.g., remdesivir) in addition to convalescent plasma therapy. No convalescent plasma therapy-related adverse events were reported in 5 studies and 3 made no mention of adverse events. Seven studies concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is or could be a useful therapeutic option; one study made no claims. Only 3 of the 13 retrieved trials underway were planned exclusively for children. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in children. We found insufficient clinical information on the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in children. Nevertheless, the positive outcomes of the few case reports published to date suggest that convalescent plasma therapy may be of potential benefit. Further research with well-designed and powered clinical trials is needed."
COVID-19 and immunity: quo vadis?,"Understanding the precise nature and durability of protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential in order to gain insight into the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to develop novel treatment strategies to this disease. Here, I succinctly summarize what is currently known and unknown about the immune response during COVID-19 and discuss whether natural infections can lead to herd immunity."
[COVID-19 preparedness in ophthalmology].,"Background: Healthcare work is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To review risk mitigation strategies in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: Risk mitigation strategies to maintain ophthalmology care, to prevent collateral damage from care disruption, and to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are summarized based on the example of a tertiary referral center in Germany. Results: Clinical management strategies included restricted access to buildings, triage systems, telemedicine approaches, strategies for rapid treat and release, and transparent communication strategies. Strategies to protect patients and staff relied on both standard hygiene precautions and the use of personal protective equipment for prevention of droplet infections. Physical barriers supported risk mitigation strategies. Conclusion: To maintain ophthalmological care during the COVID-19 pandemic, a coordinated, multifaceted approach using risk mitigation strategies to protect staff, patients, and the public was initiated."
[Standardized management guideline for pediatric wards of hematology and oncology during the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019].,"With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and growing knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment, it has been clear that children are also susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The children with hematological tumors are a special population with immunosuppression and special therapeutic characteristics. Here the management guideline for pediatric wards of hematology and oncology during COVID-19 epidemic is established based on the features of children with hematological tumors."
"Clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in North Wollo Zone, North-East Ethiopia.","Introduction: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pandemics has remained to be a public health emergency of international concern. This ongoing pandemic has resulted in the death of millions of people globally. About one and a half thousand people have died due to this illness in Ethiopia. The clinical presentations of the disease vary with geography and populations. We therefore aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in North-East Ethiopia. Methods: real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted for 18,112 individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection during June 27 to October 20, 2020, at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center. Recorded data of 372 Ethiopians who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center were retrospectively extracted and analyzed using SPSS v25.0. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: nearly 2.1% of the screened participants were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, three fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were male, with an overall median age of 30 years. About 85% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were cough (14.2%), followed by fever (11.0%) and headache (8.6%), whereas hypertension (1.6%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1.6%) diabetes mellitus (1.1%), and chronic respiratory diseases (1.1%) were relatively the most common comorbidities noted. The case-fatality ratio was found at 1.6%. Age and underlying comorbidities had a statistically significant association with severity and poor outcome of patients (P < 0.001). Conclusion: the finding from this study indicated that older age and people with underlying comorbidities are at high risk of having the severe disease and poor outcomes. Hence, appropriate care and priority should be given to these people to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by this illness. The presence of higher asymptomatic infection is the possible indicator of potential asymptomatic transmissions within the community. This highlights the need for widespread testing, and contact tracing to flatten the transmission curve."
"Postvaccination COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers, Israel.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can be mistaken for vaccine-related side effects during initial days after immunization. Among 4,081 vaccinated healthcare workers in Israel, 22 (0.54%) developed COVID-19 from 1-10 days (median 3.5 days) after immunization. Clinicians should not dismiss postvaccination symptoms as vaccine-related and should promptly test for COVID-19."
Risk for International Importations of Variant SARS-CoV-2 Originating in the United Kingdom.,A fast-spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant identified in the United Kingdom in December 2020 has raised international alarm. We analyzed data from 15 countries and estimated that the chance that this variant was imported into these countries by travelers from the United Kingdom by December 7 is >50%.
Elucidating causes of COVID-19 infection and related deaths after vaccination.,"Background and aims: Symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection has been reported in vaccination. In the current article, we try to elucidate various causes behind COVID-19 infection and mortality following COVID-19 vaccination and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. Methods: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Vaccines', 'Mortality', 'deaths', 'infections', and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate in from January to May 2021. Epidemiology, risk factors, Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination were assessed. Results: A number of factors have been associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection reported after vaccination. A high viral load, comorbidities, mutant strains, Variants of Concern (VOC) leading to Vaccine escape and casual attitude towards COVID Appropriate Behaviors appear to be the most important factors for infection and deaths after COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: COVID-19 Infection and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination are of great concern. Application of COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) before and after vaccination is essential for the population. Effective Vaccines against mutant strains and enhanced vaccination drive are key strategies to avoid this quintessential threat. Early medical intervention in high-risk groups can prevent overall mortality."
[Application of the PCR number of cycle threshold value (Ct) in COVID-19].,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists with all its virulence despite 650,382,819 doses of COVID vaccine worldwide. The reference test for infection identification is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The usefulness of this test may be diminished by simplifying its result as positive or negative. Determining the number of cycles (Ct) in positive RT-qPCR tests can assist in decision-making when interpreted in the clinical context of patients."
Biomimetic Virus-Like Particles as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Diagnostic Tools.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible disease that has affected more than 90% of the countries worldwide. At least 17 million individuals have been infected, and some countries are still battling first or second waves of the pandemic. Nucleic acid tests, especially reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have become the workhorse for early detection of COVID-19 infection. Positive controls for the molecular assays have been developed to validate each test and to provide high accuracy. However, most available positive controls require cold-chain distribution and cannot serve as full-process control. To overcome these shortcomings, we report the production of biomimetic virus-like particles (VLPs) as SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. A SARS-CoV-2 detection module for RT-PCR was encapsidated into VLPs from a bacteriophage and a plant virus. The chimeric VLPs were obtained either by in vivo reconstitution and coexpression of the target detection module and coat proteins or by in vitro assembly of purified detection module RNA sequences and coat proteins. These VLP-based positive controls mimic SARS-CoV-2 packaged ribonucleic acid (RNA) while being noninfectious. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the positive controls are scalable, stable, and can serve broadly as controls, from RNA extraction to PCR in clinical settings."
[Laboratory testing techniques for SARS-CoV-2].,"The ongoing epidemic of caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 starting in December 2019 poses a serious public health threat globally. The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia. A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death. The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak. In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system. These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches."
Detection profile of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR in different types of clinical specimens: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Testing is one of the commendable measures for curbing the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). But, it should be done using the most appropriate specimen and an accurate diagnostic test such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to determine the positive detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different clinical specimens using qRT-PCR. A total of 8136 pooled clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the majority were nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). A lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a positive rate (PR) of 71.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected in the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95% CI: 79.9%-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs; 87.8% (95% CI: 78.6%-96.9%) then sputum; 68.1% (95% CI: 56.9%-79.4%). A low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs; 7.6% (95% CI: 5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples; 1.0% (95% CI: -0.1%-2.1%) whereas no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Feces had a PR of 32.8% (95% CI:1 5.8%-49.8%). Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95% CI: 31.2%-59.7%). In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in LRT specimens while no virus was detected in urinogenital specimens. BLF had the highest PR followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had moderate PR. Low PR was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood samples while no virus was found in urine samples. Last, the virus was detected in feces, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the fecal route."
Low immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among liver transplant recipients.,"Background & aims: Two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were approved to prevent COVID-19 infection, with reported vaccine efficacy of 95%. Liver transplant (LT) recipients are at risk of lower vaccine immunogenicity and were not included in the registration trials. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this special population. Methods: LT recipients followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and healthy volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies directed against the Spike-protein (S) and Nucleocapsid-protein (N) 10-20 days after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data was collected from patients and medical records. Results: Eighty LT recipients were enrolled. Mean age was 60 years and 30% were female. Twenty-five healthy volunteer controls were younger (mean age 52.7 years, p = 0.013) and mostly female (68%, p = 0.002). All participants were negative for IgG N-protein serology, indicating immunity did not result from prior COVID-19 infection. All controls were positive for IgG S-protein serology. Immunogenicity among LT recipients was significantly lower with positive serology in only 47.5% (p <0.001). Antibody titer was also significantly lower in this group (mean 95.41 AU/ml vs. 200.5 AU/ml in controls, p <0.001). Predictors for negative response among LT recipients were older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and treatment with high dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. No serious adverse events were reported in either group. Conclusion: LT recipients developed substantially lower immunological response to the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccine. Factors influencing serological antibody responses include age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications. The findings require re-evaluation of vaccine regimens in this population. Lay summary: The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited substantially inferior immunity in liver transplant recipients. Less than half of the patients developed sufficient levels of antibodies against the virus, and in those who were positive, average antibody levels were 2x less compared to healthy controls. Factors predicting non-response were older age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications."
Diagnostic accuracy of the FebriDx host response point-of-care test in patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19.,"Introduction: Management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown. Methods: We performed a real-world diagnostic accuracy study of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR on combined nose and throat swabs. A multivariable predictive model including FebriDx, age, sex, and clinical characteristics was developed and underwent internal validation. Results: FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. FebriDx results were available after 10 min compared with 1.7 (1.6 to 2.1) hours with point-of-care PCR testing and 23.4 (17.2 to 31.1) hours with laboratory PCR testing. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model age, sex and other clinical features did not contribute significantly to the effect of the FebriDx result in distinguishing patients with and without COVID-19. Conclusions: During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool. Trial registration: ISRCTN14966673."
Incomplete humoral response including neutralizing antibodies in asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 patients in Japan.,"The pandemic of COVID-19 is still ongoing, and many studies on serum antibodies have been reported, however, there are few studies about asymptomatic and mild patients. In this study, we enrolled 44 COVID-19 patients with relatively mild disease and 48 pre-pandemic controls. We measured serum antibodies against extracellular domain, S1 domain, and receptor-binding domain of Spike and N protein, examined neutralization titers by authentic virus neutralization assay and newly-developed bead/cell-based Spike-ACE2 inhibition assay, and compared them with clinical features. Most of these antibodies, including neutralizing titers, were mutually correlated, and the production of antibodies were associated with low Ct values of PCR test, disease severity, symptoms especially pneumonia, lymphopenia, and serological test including CRP, LD, D-dimer, and procalcitonin. Notably, 87.5% of asymptomatic and 23.5% of mild patients did not have antibody against SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed the inadequate acquisition of humoral immunity in patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients."
[COVID-19-associated coagulopathy].,"In 2020, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread across the world to become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high rate of coagulopathy and thrombotic complications. The underlying mechanisms involved in these processes are complex. In addition to the low physical activity, blood coagulation activation accompanied by excessive immune/inflammatory reactions and vascular endothelialitis associated with the presence of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 and disrupted cell membranes contribute substantially to the complexity of the mechanisms. The types of thrombosis that occur include arterial thrombosis and venous thromboembolism. Microthrombi in alveolar capillaries are observed in COVID-19 patients. Considering the possible involvement of thrombosis in the worsening of COVID-19, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, such as low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, is essential for patients with moderate and severe infections. Even with prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, the incidence of thrombosis remains high. Consequently, control of the underlying inflammation and vascular endothelial protection may be required in combination with anticoagulant therapy."
"Identification of and Surveillance for the SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.427 and B.1.429 - Colorado, January-March 2021.","The B.1.427 and B.1.429 variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were first described in Southern California on January 20, 2021 (1); on March 16 they were designated variants of concern* (2). Data on these variants are limited, but initial reports suggest that, compared with other lineages, they might be more infectious (1,2), cause more severe illness (2), and be less susceptible to neutralizing monoclonal antibody products such as bamlanivimab, an investigational treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (1-3). On January 24, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) identified the first Colorado case of COVID-19 attributed to these variants. B.1.427 and B.1.429 were considered a single variant described as CAL.20C or B.1.427/B.1.429 in the 20C clade (1,3); in this report ""B.1.427/B.1.429"" refers to B.1.427 or B.1.429 lineage, including those reported as B.1.427/B.1.429 without further differentiation."
Development of a Codebook of Online Anti-Vaccination Rhetoric to Manage COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation.,"Vaccine hesitancy (delay in obtaining a vaccine, despite availability) represents a significant hurdle to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy is in part related to the prevalence of anti-vaccine misinformation and disinformation, which are spread through social media and user-generated content platforms. This study uses qualitative coding methodology to identify salient narratives and rhetorical styles common to anti-vaccine and COVID-denialist media. It organizes these narratives and rhetorics according to theme, imagined antagonist, and frequency. Most frequent were narratives centered on ""corrupt elites"" and rhetorics appealing to the vulnerability of children. The identification of these narratives and rhetorics may assist in developing effective public health messaging campaigns, since narrative and emotion have demonstrated persuasive effectiveness in other public health communication settings."
Vaccines for COVID-19: An Overview.,"The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the final months of 2019 prompted an extraordinary response on the part of the scientific community, with fundamental research on the biology of the virus and the human immune response, and development of testing, therapeutics, and vaccines occurring on an unprecedentedly short timescale. Within a year after the worldwide outbreak of the disease, more than 40 vaccine candidates had emerged, with 21 candidates in phase 3 trials or already being used on an emergency basis. Many of these vaccines have involved innovative platforms. In this concise review, the authors will summarize the characteristics and performance of the leading vaccines and discuss considerations of virus mutations and asymptomatic spread that may affect the ability of the worldwide community to use these vaccines as a means to defeat the pandemic and restore pre-COVID-19 normality."
Short Communication:Evidence of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants Circulation in Romania.,New SARS-CoV-2 variants are constantly emerging and putting a strain on public health systems by spreading faster and potentially evading immune protection through vaccination. One of these strains is the B.1.1.7 variant that has initially been described in the United Kingdom and has subsequently spread to several countries. Monitoring the amplification of the S gene-a major hotspot for molecular evolution-by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows rapidly screening for such variants. This report describes the detection of sequence variants in Romania by using this strategy followed by next-generation sequencing of the entire genome for confirmation and further characterization. One B.1.1.7 and three B.1.258 sequences were confirmed. Each of these strains presented additional mutations with possible impact on the replicative capacity. Public health strategies should be devised to ensure molecular monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 evolution during the pandemic and allow adequate and rapid reaction.
[Computed tomography (CT) utility for diagnosis and triage during COVID-19 pandemic].,"The nasopharyngeal smear with PCR analysis is the first diagnostic test proposed to confirm infection with COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. However, its usefulness in emergency centers is limited due to its imperfect sensitivity (56-83 %), limited availability and the time required to obtain results. For this reason, the chest CT-scan has been proposed as a rapid triage tool for diagnosis in these suspect Covid-19 patients. However, its specificity is limited, exposing to the risk of over-diagnosis, and further data are needed to confirm its usefulness, and to highlight the possible prognostic value of the CT, in detecting early lesions associated with poor outcome, indicating the need for admission to intensive care."
Online study of health professionals about their vaccination attitudes and behavior in the COVID-19 era: addressing participation bias.,"Online surveys of health professionals have become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 crisis because of their ease, speed of implementation, and low cost. This article leverages an online survey of general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes toward the soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines, implemented in October-November 2020 (before the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized in France), to study the evolution of the distribution of their demographic and professional characteristics and opinions about these vaccines, as the survey fieldwork progressed, as reminders were sent out to encourage them to participate. Focusing on the analysis of the potential determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, we also tested if factors related to survey participation biased the association estimates. Our results show that online surveys of health professionals may be subject to significant selection bias that can have a significant impact on estimates of the prevalence of some of these professionals' behavioral, opinion, or attitude variables. Our results also highlight the effectiveness of reminder strategies in reaching hard-to-reach professionals and reducing these biases. Finally, they indicate that weighting for nonparticipation remains indispensable and that methods exist for testing (and correcting) selection biases."
Traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Peripheral Blood Cells of Patients with COVID-19.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in patients with COVID-19, clinical characterization of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure, and septic shock. To better understand the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19, we interrogated the virus's presence in the peripheral blood cells, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By analyzing >2 billion sequence reads of high-throughput transcriptome sequence data from 180 samples of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection or healthy controls collected from 6 studies, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two samples from two independent studies. In contrast, the viral RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a ""viral spike-to-actin"" RNA normalization as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in total human RNA abundance. Our observation suggests immune presentation and discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes."
"COVID-19 infection among first responders in Broward County, Florida, March-April 2020.","Background: First responders (FRs) may have a significant risk of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) infection than the general population due to job-related exposures. We aimed to determine the prevalence and exposure patterns of COVID-19 among FRs. Methods: Between March and April 2020, FRs in Broward County, Florida, were screened for COVID-19 infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using nasopharyngeal swabs. Demographics and COVID-19 positive rate of the FRs were summarized. Results: A total of 3375 FRs were screened for COVID-19 infection. The median age of FRs tested was 42 years (IQR 33-52 years), and 1464 (43.4%) were men. A total of 2902 (85.9%) were asymptomatic, and 473 (14.1%) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19. Overall, 289 (8.6%) were positive, with the highest rates among the age between 25 and 49 years. Of those testing positive, 235 (81.3%) were asymptomatic. Fourteen days after their first positive test, 81 (69.8%) of the 116 asymptomatically infected FRs were negative, and 35 (30.2%) remained positive and asymptomatic. Conclusions: The FRs in Broward County, FL, had an overall infection rate of 8.6% at the time of COVID-19 testing, and asymptomatic FRs accounted for 81.3% of infection. Active surveillance should be focused on the asymptomatic FRs with COVID-19."
Challenges at the host-arthropod-coronavirus interface and COVID-19: a One Health approach.,"Background: The world faces the challenge posed by the interaction between hosts and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with potential role for arthropod vectors, and the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on acquired immunity, vaccine efficacy and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic control. Proposal: The characterization of the role played by animal hosts and host-virus interactions is essential to address this challenge. Zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) routes may be involved in virus transmission with a possible still unconfirmed role for arthropod vectors. Herein we propose to consider the risks posed by the possible role of arthropod vectors in COVID-19 and that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk for zoonotic virus transmission. These risks should be considered when evaluating vaccine efficacy and monitoring animal SARS-CoV-2 variants. Conclusion: Virus surveillance, epidemiology, sequencing and evaluation of susceptibility to antibodies and other protective immune mechanisms from vaccinated individuals should be improved. A One Health approach such as the one applied by our group SaBio is necessary for a more effective control of COVID-19 and prevention of future pandemics."
Is the Patient Infected with SARS-CoV-2?,The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently uses the nasopharyngeal swab specimen as the reference standard for evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assays. We propose that the patient-infected status algorithm is a superior way to classify whether an individual is infected or not infected.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Targeting Nucleocapsid or Spike Protein by Four High-Throughput Immunoassays Authorized for Emergency Use.,"A total of 1,200 serum samples that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody using the Abbott Architect immunoassay targeting the nucleocapsid protein were run in 3 SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays targeting spike proteins (DiaSorin Liaison, Ortho Vitros, and Euroimmun). Consensus-positive and consensus-negative interpretations were defined as qualitative agreement in at least 3 of the 4 assays. Agreement of the 4 individual assays with a consensus-negative interpretation (n = 610) ranged from 96.7% to 100%, and agreement with a consensus-positive interpretation (n = 584) ranged from 94.3% to 100%. Laboratory-developed inhibition assays were utilized to evaluate 49 consensus-negative samples that were positive in only one assay; true-positive reactivity was confirmed in only 2 of these 49 (4%) samples. These findings demonstrate very high levels of agreement among 4 SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays authorized for emergency use, regardless of antigen target or assay format. Although false-positive reactivity was identified, its occurrence was rare (no more than 1.7% of samples for a given assay)."
Diagnostic Tests for COVID-19.,"The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ramifications on both an individual level and a public health level. The use of appropriate testing mechanisms is paramount to preventing transmission, along with offering treatment to those who are infected and show appropriate symptomatology. The choice of employing a specific test often relies on laboratory capabilities, including the abilities of the medical technologists, the cost of testing platforms, and the individual quirks of each test. This chapter intends to discuss the relevant issues relating to diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, including specimen types and collection methods, viral detection methods, and serological testing."
Optical technologies for the detection of viruses like COVID-19: Progress and prospects.,"The outbreak of life-threatening pandemic like COVID-19 necessitated the development of novel, rapid and cost-effective techniques that facilitate detection of viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The presently popular approach of a collection of samples using the nasopharyngeal swab method and subsequent detection of RNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction suffers from false-positive results and a longer diagnostic time scale. Alternatively, various optical techniques namely optical sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging shows a great promise in virus detection. Herein, a comprehensive review of the various photonics technologies employed for virus detection, particularly the SARS-CoV family, is discussed. The state-of-art research activities in utilizing the photonics tools such as near-infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence-based techniques, super-resolution microscopy, surface plasmon resonance-based detection, for virus detection accounted extensively with an emphasis on coronavirus detection. Further, an account of emerging photonics technologies of SARS-CoV-2 detection and future possibilities is also explained. The progress in the field of optical techniques for virus detection unambiguously show a great promise in the development of rapid photonics-based devices for COVID-19 detection."
Immunity certification for COVID-19: ethical considerations.,"Restrictive measures imposed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have resulted in severe social, economic and health effects. Some countries have considered the use of immunity certification as a strategy to relax these measures for people who have recovered from the infection by issuing these individuals a document, commonly called an immunity passport. This document certifies them as having protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has advised against the implementation of immunity certification at present because of uncertainty about whether long-term immunity truly exists for those who have recovered from COVID-19 and concerns over the reliability of the proposed serological test method for determining immunity. Immunity certification can only be considered if scientific thresholds for assuring immunity are met, whether based on antibodies or other criteria. However, even if immunity certification became well supported by science, it has many ethical issues in terms of different restrictions on individual liberties and its implementation process. We examine the main considerations for the ethical acceptability of immunity certification to exempt individuals from restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as needing to meet robust scientific criteria, the ethical acceptability of immunity certification depends on its uses and policy objectives and the measures in place to reduce potential harms, and prevent disproportionate burdens on non-certified individuals and violation of individual liberties and rights."
Immunology of COVID-19.,The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 reveals a delicate balance between protective effects and harmful pathological reactions and can possibly explain the highly variable disease manifestations in subjects infected with this novel coronavirus. A better understanding of the anti-viral immune response is not only critical for vaccine development but might also provide targets for pharmaceutical and immunological treatment options. Recent research literature on immune aspects of COVID-19 is summarized in this review with an outlook how bats have evolved to live with these viral infections.
Unilateral inferior altitudinal visual field defect related to COVID-19.,"Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are still being studied. Posterior segment involvement in viral entities is either direct viral involvement or a delayed immune response to the antigen. A 22-year-old woman presented with history of perceiving absolute inferior scotoma in the right eye for 4 days and history of fever and sore throat 10 days ago. Fundus examination revealed disc edema and vessel tortuosity. Humphreys Field Analyzer confirmed inferior field defect and Optical Coherence Tomography showed superior, nasal and inferior retinal nerve fiber layer thickening in the right eye. Patient was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Patient received three doses of injection methylprednisolone over 3 days. There was subjective resolution of scotoma reported 3 weeks posttreatment. We bring forward the first reported case of parainfectious optic neuritis associated with COVID-19."
Herpes zoster after COVID vaccination.,"COVID-19 presents in various ways, but mainly as a pulmonary disease (Marzano, 2020). Skin manifestations have been reported, including reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (Marzano, 2020). Our case report describes two adults developing herpes zoster after vaccination with tozinameran (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine). A possible cause for this reaction is a transient lymphocytopenia that occurs after the vaccination - similar to that in COVID-19 disease (Mulligan, 2020; Wang, 2020; Qin, 2020; Brabilla, 2020; Wang, 2020; Wei, 2017). In the context of vaccinating older and/or immunocompromised adults, our observations can be the starting point for further evaluation of a possible relationship between COVID-19, COVID vaccines, and herpes zoster."
Isoelectric point determination by imaged CIEF of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the hACE2 receptor.,"In order to contribute to the scientific research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we have investigated the isoelectric points (pI) of several related proteins, which are commercially available: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with His- and Fc-tag, the S1 subunit with His-tag, the S1/S2 subunits with His-tag and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) with His-tag. First, the theoretical pI values, based on the amino acid (AA) sequences of the proteins, were calculated using the ProtParam tool from the Bioinformatics Resource Portal ExPASy. The proteins were then measured with the Maurice imaged CIEF system (native fluorescence detection), testing various measurement conditions, such as different ampholytes or ampholyte mixtures. Due to isoforms, we get sections with several peaks and not just one peak for each protein. The determined pI range for the RBD/Fc is 8.24-9.32 (theoretical pI: 8.55), for the RBD/His it is 7.36-9.88 (8.91) and for the S1/His it is 7.30-8.37 (7.80). The pI range of the S1/S2/His is 4.41-5.87 (no theoretical pI, AA sequence unknown) and for hACE2/His, the determined global range is 5.19-6.11 (5.60) for all experimental conditions chosen. All theoretically derived values were found within these ranges, usually close to the center. Therefore, we consider theoretical values as useful to make predictions about the isoelectric points of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The experimental conditions had only a minor influence on the pI ranges obtained and mainly influenced the peak shapes."
The Potentially Recommended Pharmacotherapy for COVID-19.,"Context: A completely unique coronavirus (2019-nCoV), formally referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), appeared in China. SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological mediator of coronavirus 2 (COVID-19), characterized by pneumonic contagion in human beings. In spite of forceful suppression, this virus has spread worldwide. No specific drugs have been approved by the FDA for treating COVID-19 patients. Objective: The study intended to examine the data from studies on clinical management of COVID-19. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. The sources of data included bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, Embase, PsychINFO, WanFang Data, and PubMed. The search terms were treatment of the novel coronavirus, management of nCoV-19, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. Setting: The study took place in the main library of the University of Sargodha in Sargodha, Pakistan. Results: The study identified 42 unique studies that had reported and confirmed over 1500 cases of nCoV-19 by April 21, 2020. The studies found that clinical management, for patients who presented with symptoms, included supportive care and control measures that comprised mechanical ventilator support and supplementary oxygen. Conclusions: There have been intensive attempts to explore drug therapy for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during this COVID-19 pandemic. Several drugs have been identified which including remdesivir, two antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and immunosuppressive agents. The effects of most drug interventions are currently highly uncertain and several drugs and vaccines are under trail for the effective treatment of COVID-19 virus, until an effective treatment will discover social distancing and physical hygiene should be practiced strictly."
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers at a London NHS Trust.,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a theoretically increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) given their occupational exposure. We tested 2,167 HCWs in a London Acute Integrated Care Organisation for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in May and June 2020 to evaluate seroprevalence. We found a seropositivity rate of 31.6% among HCWs."
An imperative to offer pregnant and lactating women access to the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out programme.,"In view of the continuing worldwide spread of COVID-19 infection, the increased morbidity and mortality from the disease during pregnancy, and the current efficacy and safety of vaccines in non-pregnant individuals, vaccines should not be withheld from women simply because of pregnancy or lactation. All pregnant women, especially healthcare professionals, should be offered vaccination and counselled about its advantages and disadvantages by their maternity care providers. Complete eradication of COVID-19 infection will be possible if potential niduses of the infection, which may act as sources for future outbreaks, are protected against the pathogen. However, if a hypothetical medication is the only means yet proven of limiting severe compromise to maternal health, access to the medication should be at the pregnant woman's discretion. Shared decision-making requires physicians to actively engage with their patients and share their knowledge about the subject matter."
[WEARING A MASK IS A PERSONAL PROTECTION AGAINST SARS-COV-2 INFECTION EVEN IN A VACCINATION-ON-BOARDING COUNTRY].,"Even with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine, masks and social distancing are recommended as a precautionary measure to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In Israel, as in many other countries, despite official regulations and widespread availability and accessibility to affordable effective masks, the use of face masks is not consistent or universal. Physicians and other medical and health professionals have a vital role to play in communicating to the public about the importance of masking and encouraging people to wear face masks correctly and consistently. This review underscores the importance of masking as a protective public health mitigation measure. It describes types of face masks mainly used by the public and their effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing barriers (e.g., physical, social, economic) to encourage widespread and sustained appropriate use of masks. The article also proposes strategies to enhance masking, such as changing social norms through targeted local interventions and governmental control of mask quality and price."
COVID-19 vaccine is here: practical considerations for clinical imaging applications.,"Imaging tools are potentially able to provide valuable data regarding the development of an efficient vaccine against viral diseases. Tracking immune cells in vivo by imaging modalities can help us understand the intrinsic behaviors of immune cells in response to vaccine components. Imaging patterns at the vaccination site and draining lymph nodes might provide useful information about the vaccine potency. Besides, serial lung CT imaging has been purposed to evaluate vaccine efficiency regarding its protection against typical lung lesions of viral pneumonias. On the other hand, vaccination causes various confusing radiologic patterns that pose diagnostic challenges for clinicians and pitfalls for reading radiologists. This manuscript reviews potential applications of imaging modalities in the process of vaccine development and also goes over some of the imaging findings/pitfalls following vaccination."
Low titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after first vaccination dose in cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.,"Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 provides significant protection against the infection in the general population. However, only limited data exist for patients with cancer under systemic therapy. Based on this, our site has initiated a study evaluating safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with solid and hematological malignancies under several systemic therapies. The initial results of the cohort of 59 patients receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors are presented here. Despite no new safety issues have been noticed, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are significantly lower in comparison to matched healthy volunteers up to day 22 post the first dose. These results should be taken into consideration for the patients under treatment."
Successful treatment of acute spleno-porto-mesenteric vein thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. A case report.,"Several cases of deep venous thrombosis in people who had recently received Vaxzevria (previously known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) have recently been reported, mainly presenting as cerebral vein/cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. This syndrome has been termed ""vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"". Acute spleno-porto-mesenteric vein thrombosis is an uncommon but serious condition with potential sequelae, such as small-bowel gangrene and end-stage liver failure. We describe a case of concomitant thrombosis of portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins in a young female patient with no other risk factors who received Vaxzevria (previously ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca) 17 days before. The diagnostic workup and the successful endovascular treatment and systemic anticoagulation management is reported."
Socio-Demographics Correlate of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey in Saudi Arabia.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is considered a major global public health threat affecting across the life course and socioeconomic aspects of life. Global acceptance to an effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution. This study aims to evaluate intent to be vaccinated among public in Saudi Arabia during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based study was designed in Saudi Arabia. Study participants (N = 658) were recruited through snowball sampling. The SurveyMonkey platform was used to record the response. Cross-tabulation was performed by participants' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 virus with sociodemographic characteristics and respondents' risk perception toward COVID-19, trust in the healthcare system, and their history of vaccine hesitancy behavior. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to compute the predictors of vaccination intention among the study participants. Results: Six hundred fifty-eight participants completed the survey (females = 47.4%). Of the 658 participants, 351 (53.3%) have shown intent to be vaccinated. Five hundred nineteen (78.8%) of the participants were reported to be at high risk of COVID-19, and 307 (46.6%) were reported to trust the healthcare system in the country. The multivariable analysis shows respondents with a high-risk perception (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.49-3.48); higher trust in the healthcare system (OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.32-4.61) was found to be the significant factor affecting the decision in acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: Participants reported high knowledge toward COVID-19 virus, and vaccine developments. About half (46.6%) of the study participants reported refusal/hesitancy toward the vaccine during the second wave of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The study highlighted that higher risk perception and higher trust in the healthcare system were found to be the main reasons for participants' intentions behind the vaccination."
A comparative evaluation between the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device and Abbott Architect SARS CoV-2 IgG assay.,"Introduction: Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as critical diagnostic markers for determining how broadly the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, confirming patient recovery, monitoring potential long-term effects of infection, and evaluating potential protection from reinfection. As new antibody tests become available, it is important to evaluate their performance and utility. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device against the Abbott ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay for the detection of the COVID-19 IgG antibody. Methods: Two panels of specimens were utilized to challenge both antibody tests: (1) a set of 150 prepandemic negative specimens collected in 2014, and (2) a set of 122 specimens from 87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US and UK that were confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result. Results: The ArchitectTM test had a specificity of 100 % and sensitivity of 99.1 % and 93.9 % when excluding or including immunocompromised patients, respectively for specimens collected >14 days post symptom onset or >5 days post-RNA testing. The PanbioTM test had 99.3 % agreement to ArchitectTM. Notably, N = 6 immune-compromised individuals were identified that did not develop detectable antibodies by day 30. Conclusion: There is good concordance between the ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay and PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS CoV-2 IgG."
Nanocarrier vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.,"The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has seen rapid spread, disease morbidities and death associated with substantive social, economic and societal impacts. Treatments rely on re-purposed antivirals and immune modulatory agents focusing on attenuating the acute respiratory distress syndrome. No curative therapies exist. Vaccines remain the best hope for disease control and the principal global effort to end the pandemic. Herein, we summarize those developments with a focus on the role played by nanocarrier delivery."
Analysis of the Fatality Rate in Relation to Testing Capacity during the First 50 days of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Italy.,"Italy has been one of the most severely affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the case fatality rate (CFR) estimated based on Italian data is one of the highest worldwide. We analyzed public data from the first 50 days of the epidemic in Italy (from February 24 to April 13, 2020) to evaluate whether evolving testing strategies and capacity could account for trends in the CFR. The CFR increased during the study period, and a significant positive correlation was found between the CFR and the percentage of positive tests among performed real-time PCR tests (positive tests % [POS%]) until March 25, suggesting the surveillance system did not detect a growing number of cases in the initial phase of the epidemic. To avoid distortion due to the delay between the identification of cases and deaths, the expected CFR (expCFR) was calculated, which represents the ratio between the predicted number of cases and deaths at the end of the epidemic based on the best fitting logistic curves of the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths. The expCFR began a downward trend from the 40th day. In the final phase, a decrease in both expCFR and POS% was identified, suggesting an improvement in surveillance. The results of this study suggest data from the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy were severely affected by ascertainment bias. Insufficient testing and isolation of cases could have facilitated the widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the early stages of the outbreak."
Induction of SARS-CoV-2 Protein S-Specific CD8+ T Cells in the Lungs of gp96-Ig-S Vaccinated Mice.,"Given the aggressive spread of COVID-19-related deaths, there is an urgent public health need to support the development of vaccine candidates to rapidly improve the available control measures against SARS-CoV-2. To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation."
"Sample collection and transport strategies to enhance yield, accessibility, and biosafety of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing.","Introduction. Non-invasive sample collection and viral sterilizing buffers have independently enabled workflows for more widespread COVID-19 testing by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Gap statement. The combined use of sterilizing buffers across non-invasive sample types to optimize sensitive, accessible, and biosafe sampling methods has not been directly and systematically compared.Aim. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic yield across different non-invasive samples with standard viral transport media (VTM) versus a sterilizing buffer eNAT- (Copan diagnostics Murrieta, CA) in a point-of-care diagnostic assay system.Methods. We prospectively collected 84 sets of nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva, from 52 COVID-19 RT-PCR-confirmed patients, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 37 patients. Nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva were placed in either VTM or eNAT, prior to testing with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert). The sensitivity of each sampling strategy was compared using a composite positive standard.Results. Swab specimens collected in eNAT showed an overall superior sensitivity compared to swabs in VTM (70 % vs 57 %, P=0.0022). Direct saliva 90.5 %, (95 % CI: 82 %, 95 %), followed by NP swabs in VTM and saliva in eNAT, was significantly more sensitive than nasal swabs in VTM (50 %, P<0.001) or eNAT (67.8 %, P=0.0012) and oral swabs in VTM (50 %, P<0.0001) or eNAT (58 %, P<0.0001). Saliva and use of eNAT buffer each increased detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the Xpert; however, no single sample matrix identified all positive cases.Conclusion. Saliva and eNAT sterilizing buffer can enhance safe and sensitive detection of COVID-19 using point-of-care GeneXpert instruments."
International travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: implications and risks associated with 'travel bubbles'.,"Air travel is considered as the major route that facilitated the distribution of COVID-19 across international borders. Passengers with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can bypass the symptom-based surveillance systems established in the airports. Travel bubbles should be considered as an effective compromise in preventive strategies. Therefore, strict preventive measures have to be implemented at the entry and exit points in addition to the measures taken for preventing on-board transmission SARS-CoV-2."
Treatment Options for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Patients With Reduced or Absent Kidney Function.,"Coronavirus disease 2019, the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, was first identified in the Hubei Province of China in late 2019. Currently, the only role for therapy is treatment of the disease, as opposed to postexposure prophylaxis, however multiple clinical trials are currently ongoing for both treatment and prophylaxis. Treating coronavirus disease 2019 relies on two components; the first is inhibition of the viral entrance and replication within the body and the second is inhibition of an exacerbated immune response which can be seen in patients with severe disease. Many drugs have shown in vitro antiviral activity; however, clinical trials have not been as promising. This review summarizes the current data for the most commonly used drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 and will cover the unique factors that may affect the dosing of these medications in patients with CKD. While clinical trials are ongoing, most are in patients with normal kidney function. During a pandemic, when patients with CKD are at higher risk of both infection and death, it is imperative to include patients these patients in the clinical trials."
Low In-School COVID-19 Transmission and Asymptomatic Infection Despite High Community Prevalence.,"There is concern that in-person schooling during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will facilitate disease transmission. Through asymptomatic surveillance and contact tracing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we found low rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and little in-school transmission of COVID-19 when physical distancing and masking strategies were enforced despite a high community prevalence of COVID-19."
Aftermath of fortnightly universal testing for severe acute respiratory corona virus-2 infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients.,"Introduction: Asymptomatic maintenance hemodialysis patients with acute respiratory corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) are missed with pre-dialysis screening without testing. The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in curbing transmission. Methods: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) modeling assuming R0 of 2.2. Results: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. Conclusions: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit."
COVID-19 and the liver: A 2021 update.,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China and has since resulted in a global pandemic in excess of 165 million reported infections and 3.4 million attributable deaths. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, which may be complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is also responsible for numerous extrapulmonary manifestations involving the haematologic, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, endocrinologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic and dermatologic systems. This review will discuss the pathophysiology of COVID-19; focusing on the mechanisms and outcomes of liver injury associated with COVID-19; its impact on chronic liver disease (CLD); management of CLD during the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on CLD."
The Importance of a Timely Second Dose of the 2021 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Depends on the Protection Afforded by a First Dose and Subsequent Risk of Anaphylaxis.,"Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents our greatest hope to combat the devastating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Amid ongoing global vaccination efforts, rare cases of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have received significant attention. Although the exact nature of these reactions may be heterogeneous, various approaches exist to engage with patients, communities, public health departments, primary care providers, and other clinicians in a multidisciplinary approach to advance population health. Whereas it is optimal for patients to receive COVID-19 vaccination as outlined in emergency use authorizations, second-dose deferral of mRNA vaccines may be a consideration within a shared decision-making paradigm of care in select circumstances characterized by high durable first-vaccine-dose protection and significant elevations of vaccine anaphylaxis risk. Still, the durability of protection afforded by a single dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is uncertain, and alternative approaches to complete vaccination, including precautionary use of a COVID-19 viral vector vaccine, also remain patient-preference-sensitive options. There is an urgent need to define correlates of COVID-19 immunity and the level of longer-term protection afforded by COVID-19 vaccination."
Establishing the prevalence of common tissue-specific autoantibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.,"Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) has been associated with both transient and persistent systemic symptoms that do not appear to be a direct consequence of viral infection. The generation of autoantibodies has been proposed as a mechanism to explain these symptoms. To understand the prevalence of autoantibodies associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we investigated the frequency and specificity of clinically relevant autoantibodies in 84 individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, suffering from COVID-19 of varying severity in both the acute and convalescent setting. These were compared with results from 32 individuals who were on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) for non-COVID reasons. We demonstrate a higher frequency of autoantibodies in the COVID-19 ITU group compared with non-COVID-19 ITU disease control patients and that autoantibodies were also found in the serum 3-5 months post-COVID-19 infection. Non-COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID-19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies. Our results demonstrate that respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the detection of a limited profile of tissue-specific autoantibodies, detectable using routine clinical immunology assays. Further studies are required to determine whether these autoantibodies are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or a phenomenon arising from severe viral infections and to determine the clinical significance of these autoantibodies."
Seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among healthcare workers with differing levels of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient exposure.,"Healthcare employees were tested for antibodies against severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among 734 employees, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.6%. Employees with heavy coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure had similar antibody prevalence as those with limited or no exposure. Guidelines for PPE use seem effective for preventing COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers."
"Challenges of SARS-CoV-2 prevention in flights, suggested solutions with potential on-site diagnosis resembling cancer biomarkers and urgency of travel medicine.","Objective: The current pandemic makes the international flights facing multiple challenges including infection during flights. Here the objective is to analyze the infection trend of flights from a regional data set and discuss the solutions for diagnosis and travel medicine. Materials and methods: The public data was applied for trend analysis and new solutions were provided based on the current diagnosis information and resembling cancer diagnosis. Results: Flights infection has decreased since the large-scale cease of flights. Challenges of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in flights exist due to testing accuracy, asymptomatic and many other factors including people gathering. To avoid the pandemic worsen, the solutions are provided for new coming flight resumes. Hotel, mandatory PPE, airport diagnosis, rapid imaging/biomarker diagnosis by advanced high-technology and emergency-travel medicine department are suggested as solutions. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 prevention in flights needs multiple solutions by potential on-site diagnosis and urgent establishment of a travel medicine unit at airport."
Animal Coronavirus Diseases: Parallels with COVID-19 in Humans.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus in humans, has expanded globally over the past year. COVID-19 remains an important subject of intensive research owing to its huge impact on economic and public health globally. Based on historical archives, the first coronavirus-related disease recorded was possibly animal-related, a case of feline infectious peritonitis described as early as 1912. Despite over a century of documented coronaviruses in animals, the global animal industry still suffers from outbreaks. Knowledge and experience handling animal coronaviruses provide a valuable tool to complement our understanding of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we present an overview of coronaviruses, clinical signs, COVID-19 in animals, genome organization and recombination, immunopathogenesis, transmission, viral shedding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. By drawing parallels between COVID-19 in animals and humans, we provide perspectives on the pathophysiological mechanisms by which coronaviruses cause diseases in both animals and humans, providing a critical basis for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against these deadly viruses."
COVID-19 vaccine development: a pediatric perspective.,"Purpose of review: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Operation Warp Speed aims to accelerate the development of a safe and effective vaccine by early 2021. Multiple vaccine candidates with reassuring safety and efficacy profiles have advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the burden of COVID-19 in children, to update pediatricians about adult COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, to discuss the importance of COVID-19 vaccine trials in children and to instill confidence in the established vaccine development and licensure processes. Recent findings: Children of all ages are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease manifestations. Children are also susceptible to downstream effects of COVID-19, including social isolation and interruption in education. Developing a pediatric COVID-19 vaccine could prevent disease, mitigate downstream effects and enable children to re-engage in their world. Summary: Children could benefit both directly and indirectly from vaccination. In light of the safety and immunogenicity results from recent adult COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, children should have the opportunity to be included in clinical trials in parallel to ongoing adult phase 3 clinical trials in a manner that is careful, methodical and transparent."
Pooling of coronavirus tests under unknown prevalence.,"Diagnostic testing for the novel coronavirus is an important tool to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby a number of probes are 'pooled' (i.e. grouped), is known to increase the capacity for testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors are considered. The results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects."
Impact of repurposed drugs on the symptomatic COVID-19 patients.,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus capable of causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared as a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, by the World Health Organization. In this devastating situation, precautionary measures, early diagnosis, and repurposed drugs appear to be timely and decisive factors by which to handle this problem until the discovery of an effective, dedicated vaccine or medicine is made. Currently, some researchers and clinicians have claimed evidence exists in favor of the use of some antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) antiviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir) vitamins, traditional Chinese medicines, and herbal medicines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the available literature, this review article sought to highlight the current understanding of the origin, transmission, diagnosis, precautionary measures, infection and drug action mechanisms, therapeutic role, and toxicities of targeted drugs for the prevention and cure of COVID-19. This review may be useful for developing further strategies as a blueprint and understanding the mentioned drugs' mechanisms to elucidate the possible target of action by which to successfully freeze the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
No psychological vaccination: Vaccine hesitancy is associated with negative psychiatric outcomes among Israelis who received COVID-19 vaccination.,"Background: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. Results: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). Limitations: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals."
"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China.","On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection."
Optimal size of sample pooling for RNA pool testing: An avant-garde for scaling up severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 testing.,"Background and objectives: Timely diagnosis is essential for the containment of the disease and breaks in the chain of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present situation demands the countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, workforce and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Materials and methods: We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2-48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% confidence interval [CL]; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of six samples. For the pool size of six samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38. Conclusions: The pooling of samples is a practical way for scaling up testing and ultimately containing the further spread of the CoV disease 2019 pandemic."
SARS-CoV-2 testing to assure safety in air travel.,"To support the resumption of travel, rational and consistent testing and quarantine guidelines will be critical. Uniformity in the documentation of COVID-19 test results and vaccination will also be important. We discuss evidence to support standardized testing and quarantine requirements and propose a strategy to allow ease in travel planning."
Development of a point-of-care test to detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva which combines a simple RNA extraction method with colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification detection.,"The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a major public health concern, with a high burden and risk for infection among patients and healthcare workers. Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising alternative for COVID-19 testing using nasopharyngeal swab samples. To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a point-of-care test (POCT) using saliva was conceptualized. We have developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples using semi-alkaline proteinase, a sputum homogenizer typically used for preparing samples for tuberculosis testing, and a subsequent simple heating step with no need for centrifugation or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach (RT-LAMP) which utilizes colorimetric readout using a heat block, with results evaluated with the unaided eye. In 44 clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, the test took 45 min, and resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (21/21), compared to the reference standard. The limit of detection was 250 copies/reaction (25,000 copies/mL). Our newly developed POCT approach achieved simple RNA extraction and constant RT-LAMP detection. This POCT has the potential to be used for simple inspection stations in a field setting, helping reduce the risk of infection by simplifying and accelerating testing for COVID-19."
[Diagnostic approach and evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19].,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Most patients recover from COVID-19 within a few weeks, but some patients have symptoms lasting for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cough. This is a review of what we currently know about the clinical disease and its severity as well as which diagnostic strategies are recommended during and after hospital admission."
"Phylogenomics reveals viral sources, transmission, and potential superinfection in early-stage COVID-19 patients in Ontario, Canada.","The emergence and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the importance of infectious disease surveillance, particularly during the early stages. Viral genomes can provide key insights into transmission chains and pathogenicity. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from thirty-two of the first SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (March 18-30) in Kingston Ontario, Canada. Viral genomes were sequenced using Ion Torrent (n = 24) and MinION (n = 27) sequencing platforms. SARS-CoV-2 genomes carried forty-six polymorphic sites including two missense and three synonymous variants in the spike protein gene. The D614G point mutation was the predominate viral strain in our cohort (92.6%). A heterozygous variant (C9994A) was detected by both sequencing platforms but filtered by the ARTIC network bioinformatic pipeline suggesting that heterozygous variants may be underreported in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. Phylogenetic analysis with 87,738 genomes in the GISAID database identified global origins and transmission events including multiple, international introductions as well as community spread. Reported travel history validated viral introduction and transmission inferred by phylogenetic analysis. Molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics may complement contact tracing and help reconstruct transmission chains of emerging diseases. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to limit future pandemics."
Individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccination in China.,"Background: Vaccinations are an effective choice to stop disease outbreaks, including COVID-19. There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. Objective: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. Methods: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. Results: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. Conclusions: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage."
"Children with coronavirus disease 2019: A review of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features in pediatric patients.","There is a current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a global spread. With the rapid increase in the number of infections, an increase is observed in the number of children with COVID-19. Most research findings are regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children. Evidence-based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients. In this review, we included 2597 pediatric patients that reported recently and evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID-19. We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients. Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children and to develop strategies to control the disease transmission."
"Dealing With Liver Transplantation during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Normothermic Machine Perfusion Enables for Donor, Organ, and Recipient Assessment: A Case Report.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed life on a global scale. The numbers of transplantations have plummeted as a result of fear of disease transmission, recipient coronavirus disease 2019 infection, priority shift, and resource limitations. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complicates transplantation because donor testing, (re)allocation of limited resources, and recipient testing may exceed permissible ischemia times. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) helps safely prolong liver preservation up to 38 hours. Additional time is essential under the current circumstances. Here we present the case of a 29-year-old liver transplant recipient in whom prolonged liver preservation required for SARS-CoV-2 screening was accomplished through NMP. Donor and recipient test results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and intensive care unit capacity was eventually available. The surgical procedure and postoperative course were uneventful. NMP can extend preservation times in liver transplantation while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 test results and available intensive care unit capacity."
"Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infections among household and other close contacts of confirmed cases, the Netherlands, February to May 2021.","Several studies report high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease, however an important knowledge gap is the vaccine effectiveness against transmission (VET). We present estimates of the VET to household and other close contacts in the Netherlands, from February to May 2021, using contact monitoring data. The secondary attack rate among household contacts was lower for fully vaccinated than unvaccinated index cases (11% vs 31%), with an adjusted VET of 71% (95% confidence interval: 63-77)."
COVID-19 vaccination in patients with epilepsy: First experiences in a German tertiary epilepsy center.,"Introduction: Due to the high demand for information regarding COVID-19 vaccination in people with epilepsy (PWE), we assessed the symptoms and seizure control of PWE following their COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: All adult patients who were treated at our center were asked to report on their vaccination status and, if vaccinated, about their experiences following their first COVID-19 vaccination with regard to adverse effects and seizure control. Results: Fifty-four PWE have already received their first vaccination against COVID-19 (27 female, 20% seizure free, 96<% on antiseizure medication) and were included in the study. Two-thirds tolerated the vaccines generally either very well or well. Thirty-three percent reported general vaccination adverse effects. The most frequently reported general adverse effects were, in descending order, headache, fatigue and fever, and shivering. With regard to epilepsy-related adverse effects, one patient reported increased seizure frequency one day after the first COVID-19 vaccination was administered, and one reported the occurrence of a new seizure type. None of the patients reported a status epilepticus or aggravation of preexisting adverse effects. Conclusions: Our data suggest that vaccination against COVID-19 appears to be well tolerated in PWE, supporting the recommendation of vaccination to PWE."
COVID-19 and the immune system.,"A close interaction between the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system of an individual results in a diverse clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. While adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance, the innate immune cells, such as macrophages, may contribute, in some cases, to the disease progression. Macrophages have shown a significant production of IL-6, suggesting they may contribute to the excessive inflammation in COVID-19 disease. Macrophage Activation Syndrome may further explain the high serum levels of CRP, which are normally lacking in viral infections. In adaptive immune responses, it has been revealed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exhibit functional exhaustion patterns, such as the expression of NKG2A, PD-1, and TIM-3. Since SARS-CoV-2 restrains antigen presentation by downregulating MHC class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role. Specific IgA response appears to be stronger and more persistent than the IgM response. Moreover, IgM and IgG antibodies show similar dynamics in COVID-19 disease."
"Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of ""one health"" approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats."
SARS-CoV-2: vaccines in the pandemic era.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused millions of infections and deaths worldwide since its emergence in December 2019. As there is little or no natural immunity in the human population or specific anti-COVID-19 drugs, researchers from the government, academia and industry are developing vaccines at an unprecedented speed to halt the pandemic. In this review, the results of animal experiments and clinical trials on several vaccine technical platforms are summarized, and several challenges are also discussed to further promote the development, evaluation and application of vaccines during the challenging situation of the global pandemic."
Will vaccination refusal prolong the war on SARS-CoV-2?,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan, China in January 2020 and caused a global pandemic drastically changing everyday life. Currently, there are vaccine candidates in clinical trials and development, so it is only a matter of time before one is authorised for human use. Materials and methods: We collected public opinion survey results about attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination conducted in 2020 in 26 European countries. Results: The pooled surveys were conducted on a total of 24 970 participants; on average only 58% (n=14 365/24 970) of responders across Europe were willing to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available, 16% (n=3998/24 970) were neutral, and 26% (n=6607/24 970) were not planning to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Such a low vaccination response could make it exceedingly difficult to reach the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Conclusion: It is very important to start conducting educational public health activities on the topic of vaccination as soon as possible, before a vaccine becomes available, in order to improve attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Only by educating the general public about the benefits, safety and efficacy of vaccines can we hope to avoid the unnecessary prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Payment in challenge studies: ethics, attitudes and a new payment for risk model.","Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) research involves the infection of otherwise healthy participants with disease often for the sake of vaccine development. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the urgency of enhancing CHIM research capability and the importance of having clear ethical guidance for their conduct. The payment of CHIM participants is a controversial issue involving stakeholders across ethics, medicine and policymaking with allegations circulating suggesting exploitation, coercion and other violations of ethical principles. There are multiple approaches to payment: reimbursement, wage payment and unlimited payment. We introduce a new Payment for Risk Model, which involves paying for time, pain and inconvenience and for risk associated with participation. We give philosophical arguments based on utility, fairness and avoidance of exploitation to support this. We also examine a cross-section of the UK public and CHIM experts. We found that CHIM participants are currently paid variable amounts. A representative sample of the UK public believes CHIM participants should be paid approximately triple the UK minimum wage and should be paid for the risk they endure throughout participation. CHIM experts believe CHIM participants should be paid more than double the UK minimum wage but are divided on the payment for risk. The Payment for Risk Model allows risk and pain to be accounted for in payment and could be used to determine ethically justifiable payment for CHIM participants.Although many research guidelines warn against paying large amounts or paying for risk, our empirical findings provide empirical support to the growing number of ethical arguments challenging this status quo. We close by suggesting two ways (value of statistical life or consistency with risk in other employment) by which payment for risk could be calculated."
Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of upper respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients by virus isolation using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.,"Background: An outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated respiratory infectious diseases (COVID-19) emerged in 2019 and has spread rapidly in humans around the world. The demonstration of in vitro infectiousness of respiratory specimens is an informative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19; accordingly, viral isolation assays in cell culture are an important aspect of laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19. Methods: We developed a simple and rapid protocol for isolating SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, a cell line that is highly susceptible to the virus. We also investigated a correlation between isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and viral load detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using N2 primer/probe set that has been developed for testing of COVID-19 in Japan. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol did not require blind passage of inoculated cells and yielded the results of viral isolation within 7 days after inoculation. Specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <20.2, determined by rRT-PCR, were predicted to be isolation-positive. On the other hand, 6.9% of specimens with Ct values >35 were virus isolation-positive, indicating that low viral loads (high Ct values) in upper respiratory specimens do not always indicate no risk of containing transmissible virus. Conclusion: In combination with rRT-PCR, the SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol provides a means for assessing the potential risk of transmissible virus in upper respiratory specimens."
Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Systems Pharmacology in Drug Prevention and Treatment against COVID-19.,"A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is causing the severe acute pneumonia (COVID-19) and rapid spread nationally and internationally, resulting in a major global health emergency. Chinese governments and scientists have implemented a series of rigorous measures and scientific research to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. It has been proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts an important role in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Although the therapeutic effects of these TCM formulas are attractive, the molecular mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. An emerging strategy of systems pharmacology has been proposed to be a promising method to interpret drug action in complex biological systems and quickly screen out the bioactive compounds from TCM to treat treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in this study, the epidemiology, TCM therapy, and the systems pharmacology-based method for TCM are reviewed for COVID-19 to provide a perspective for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further efforts should be made to reduce disease burden and improve the ability to design antiviral drugs and vaccines, which will benefit the health care system, economic development and even social stability."
Small Solitary Ground-Glass Nodule on CT as an Initial Manifestation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019 led to large numbers of people being infected and developing atypical pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). Typical imaging manifestations of patients infected with 2019-nCoV has been reported, but we encountered an atypical radiological manifestation on baseline computed tomography (CT) images in three patients from Wuhan, China infected with the 2019-nCoV. Surprisingly, the only similar CT finding was a solitary sub-centimeter ground-glass nodule adjacent to bronchovascular bundles, which could be easily overlooked. In addition, the follow-up images in these patients showed how COVID-19 pneumonia evolved from these small nodules. The radiologic manifestation of the three cases will expand contemporary understanding of COVID-19."
Consecutive false-negative rRT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 in patients after clinical recovery from COVID-19.,"This study reviewed the serial real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results of 37 patients admitted to our hospital in Wuhan, China, who had three or more sequential negative results before discharge. Of these 37 patients, 14 (~38%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after a negative result during convalescence, and 5 (~14%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after two consecutive negative results during convalescence. These results suggest that it may be necessary to require that patients have three consecutive negative results before discharge, to ensure that they do not spread infection among members of their household, or in the community. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it is not currently the standard of care to require patients to have three consecutive negative results before discharge. Our results suggest that a relatively high proportion of patients may continue to shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after they have clinically recovered, and thus may transmit the infection to others."
COVID-19: an update on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.,"The unexpected pandemic set off by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide. COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(4): 191-205]."
Supply and delivery of vaccines for global health.,"Vaccines developed in high-income countries have been enormously successful in reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, saving perhaps 2.5 million lives per year, but even for successful cases, like the rotavirus vaccine, global implementation may take a decade or more. For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60-80% of the world's population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19."
"First detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America: A study in Louisiana, USA.","We investigated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater samples in southern Louisiana, USA. Untreated and treated wastewater samples were collected on five occasions over a four-month period from January to April 2020. The wastewater samples were concentrated via ultrafiltration (Method A), and an adsorption-elution method using electronegative membranes (Method B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 2 out of 15 wastewater samples using two reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays (CDC N1 and N2). None of the secondary treated and final effluent samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America, including the USA. However, concentration methods and RT-qPCR assays need to be refined and validated to increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater."
Deep Bidirectional Classification Model for COVID-19 Disease Infected Patients.,"In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China and has been reported in many countries with millions of people infected within only four months. Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Therefore, the proposed MADE-DBM model can be used in real-time COVID-19 classification systems."
"Test, trace, isolate: evidence for declining SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity in a clinical cohort.","Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on upper respiratory tract (URT) samples is the primary method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections and guide public health measures, with a supportive role for serology. We reinforce previous findings on limited sensitivity of PCR testing, and solidify this fact by statistically utilizing a firm basis of multiple tests per individual. We integrate stratifications with respect to several patient characteristics such as severity of disease and time since onset of symptoms. Bayesian statistical modelling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 80% - 95%; increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases. Negative URT RT-PCR results should be interpreted in the context of clinical characteristics, especially with regard to containment of viral transmission based on 'test, trace and isolate'. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR, serology, sensitivity, public health."
[Contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus based on cluster epidemics of COVID-19 in Guangzhou].,"Objective: To analyze the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in cluster epidemics in Guangzhou and provide evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: All the individuals identified to be infected with 2019-nCoV in Guangzhou, including confirmed cases and asymptomatic cases, were included and classified as imported cases and local cases. The first case of each cluster epidemic was defined as index case, and the number of subsequent infections was calculated to evaluate the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in the shortest incubation period of 1-3 days. Results: As of 18 February, 2020, a total of 349 cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 339 confirmed cases (97.13%) and 10 asymptomatic cases (2.87%) were reported in Guangzhou. There were 68 clusters involving 217 2019-nCoV infection cases (210 confirmed cases and 7 asymptomatic cases). The median number of subsequent infections caused by an index case in a cluster epidemic was 3, among which 2 were confirmed cases and 1 was asymptomatic cases, respectively. The average number of contagiousness was 2.18 in shorted incubation period of 1-3 days (The average number of infected cases were 2.18 cases by the index case in a cluster epidemic), the average infection number in family members was 1.86, and the infection ratio of family member transmission was 85.32% (1.86/2.18). The secondary attack rate in close contacts with shortest incubation period of 1-3 days was 17.12%-18.99%, the secondary attack rate in family members was 46.11%-49.56%. Conclusions: The cluster epidemic of COVID-19 in Guangzhou mainly occurred in families, the contagiousness was high. It is necessary to strengthen the prevention and control to reduce the community transmission of COVID-19."
Probable causes and risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 test in recovered patients: Evidence from Brunei Darussalam.,"Case reports of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who have been discharged and subsequently report positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction again (hereafter referred as ""re-positive"") do not fully describe the magnitude and significance of this issue. To determine the re-positive rate (proportion) and review probable causes and outcomes, we conduct a retrospective study of all 119 discharged patients in Brunei Darussalam up till April 23. Patients who were discharged are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days and undergo nasopharyngeal specimen collection postdischarge. Discharged patients found to be re-positive were readmitted. We reviewed the clinical and epidemiological records of all discharged patients and apply log-binomial models to obtain risk ratios for re-positive status. One in five recovered patients subsequently test positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-this risk is more than six times higher in persons aged 60 years and above. The average Ct value of re-positive patients was lower predischarge compared with their readmission Ct value. Out of 111 close contacts tested, none were found to be positive as a result of exposure to a re-positive patient. Our findings support prolonged but intermittent viral shedding as the probable cause for this phenomenon. We did not observe infectivity potential in these patients."
Genetic Aspects and Immune Responses in Covid-19: Important Organ Involvement.,"In the last two decades, the world has experienced outbreaks of three major coronaviruses with high morbidity and mortality rates. The most recent of these started in the form of an unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and now the world is facing a serious pandemic. This new disease has been called COVID-19 and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Understanding the specific genetic and phenotypic structure of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis is vital in finding appropriate drugs and vaccines. With this in mind, this review sheds light on the virology, genetics, immune-responses, and mechanism of action of this virus."
Clinical Validation and Performance Evaluation of the Automated Vitros Total Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Assay for Screening of Serostatus in COVID-19.,"Objectives: Evaluation of serostatus against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as an important tool in identification of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. Results: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples and was concordant with other serologic assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% more than 7 days after symptom onset. The CoV2T assay was robust to icterus and lipemia but had interference from significant hemolysis. Conclusions: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, the use of the CoV2T and other serologic assays in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 is unknown and must be evaluated in future studies."
Antibody Responses After mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination in Residential Older Adults: Implications for Reopening.,"Objective: COVID-19 disproportionately impacts residents in long-term care facilities. Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated, older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities. Design: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 - April 1, 2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. Setting and population: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities, who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. Methods: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels, and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. Results: All participants (N = 70) had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males, advanced age, current use of steroids, and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated (P < .001) with Beckman Coulter antibody levels [D614 G NT50, rs = 0.91; B.1.1.7 (UK) NT50, rs = 0.91]. Conclusions and implications: Higher functioning, healthier, residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies, but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes."
Anomaly Identification during Polymerase Chain Reaction for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 Using Artificial Intelligence Trained from Simulated Data.,"Real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR is the gold standard for detecting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its sensitivity and specificity, thereby meeting the demand for the rising number of cases. The scarcity of trained molecular biologists for analyzing PCR results makes data verification a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) was designed to ease verification, by detecting atypical profiles in PCR curves caused by contamination or artifacts. Four classes of simulated real-time RT-PCR curves were generated, namely, positive, early, no, and abnormal amplifications. Machine learning (ML) models were generated and tested using small amounts of data from each class. The best model was used for classifying the big data obtained by the Virology Laboratory of Simon Bolivar University from real-time RT-PCR curves for SARS-CoV-2, and the model was retrained and implemented in a software that correlated patient data with test and AI diagnoses. The best strategy for AI included a binary classification model, which was generated from simulated data, where data analyzed by the first model were classified as either positive or negative and abnormal. To differentiate between negative and abnormal, the data were reevaluated using the second model. In the first model, the data required preanalysis through a combination of prepossessing. The early amplification class was eliminated from the models because the numbers of cases in big data was negligible. ML models can be created from simulated data using minimum available information. During analysis, changes or variations can be incorporated by generating simulated data, avoiding the incorporation of large amounts of experimental data encompassing all possible changes. For diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, this type of AI is critical for optimizing PCR tests because it enables rapid diagnosis and reduces false positives. Our method can also be used for other types of molecular analyses."
"Understanding, Verifying, and Implementing Emergency Use Authorization Molecular Diagnostics for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought a new wave of challenges to health care, particularly in the area of rapid diagnostic test development and implementation. The diagnosis of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critically dependent on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs). While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with the EUA classification, and thus, assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with the supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests. Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens."
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a live virus vaccine candidate.,"Background: Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, this virus has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Methods: Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type format or a membrane-anchored format lacking the polybasic cleavage site. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these NDV-based vaccines were investigated. Findings: We report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly in mice. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs. Interpretation: The results suggested that the NDV vector expressing either the wild type S or membrane-anchored S without the polybasic cleavage site could be used as live vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Funding: This work is supported by an NIAID funded Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) contract, the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVIC) contract, philanthropic donations and NIH grants."
Practical guide for pediatric pulmonologists on imaging management of pediatric patients with COVID-19.,"Understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly evolving with new articles on the subject daily. This flood of articles can be overwhelming for busy practicing clinicians looking for key pieces of information that can be applied in daily practice. This review article synthesizes the reported imaging findings in pediatric Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the literature, offers imaging differential diagnostic considerations and useful radiographic features to help differentiate these entities from COVID-19, and provides recommendations for requesting imaging studies to evaluate suspected cases of pediatric COVID-19."
"COVID-19 in a cohort of pregnant women and their descendants, the MOACC-19 study.","Purpose: The Mother and Child COVID-19 study is a cohort recruiting pregnant women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic in order to ascertain consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their descendants. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary results as recruitment is still open. Participants: Three subcohorts can be identified at recruitment. Subcohort 1 includes women giving birth between 23 March and 25 May 2020; they have been retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their third trimester of pregnancy. Subcohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26 May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Subcohort 3 includes women in their 12 week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26 May 2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a nasopharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis. Findings to date: As of 22 October, 1167 women have been recruited (266, 354 and 547 for subcohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Fourteen women tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the day of delivery. All 14 children born from these women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future plans: Children from women included in subcohort 3 are expected to be recruited by the end of 2020. Children will be followed-up for 1 year in order to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development."
Pathogenicity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV-A quick overview and comparison with other emerging viruses.,"A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted."
COVID-19 Vaccination-Associated Axillary Adenopathy: Imaging Findings and Follow-Up Recommendations in 23 Women.,"The purpose of this article is to report on 23 women with evidence of axillary adenopathy at breast imaging after recent COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 13% of patients had symptoms (axillary lump), 43% were undergoing screening, and 43% were undergoing diagnostic imaging for other reasons. BI-RADS category 2 was assigned in one case, BI-RADS 3 in 21 (ultrasound in 4-24 weeks), and BI-RADS 4 in one. Radiologist familiarity and evidence-based guidelines are needed to avoid follow-up imaging and biopsies for reactive adenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination."
Surgical Mask Partition Reduces the Risk of Noncontact Transmission in a Golden Syrian Hamster Model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium- to large-sized respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission may be possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. Methods: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. Results: Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Unlike the severe manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naive hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model. This is the first in vivo experimental evidence to support the possible benefit of surgical mask in prevention of COVID-19 transmission, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals."
mRNA vaccination in people over 80 years of age induces strong humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with cross neutralization of P.1 Brazilian variant.,"Age is the major risk factor for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection and older people have received priority consideration for COVID-19 vaccination. However, vaccine responses are often suboptimal in this age group and few people over the age of 80 years were included in vaccine registration trials. We determined the serological and cellular response to spike protein in 100 people aged 80-96 years at 2 weeks after the second vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Antibody responses were seen in every donor with high titers in 98%. Spike-specific cellular immune responses were detectable in only 63% and correlated with humoral response. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased antibody responses after one vaccine and antibody and cellular responses remained 28-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, after dual vaccination. Post-vaccine sera mediated strong neutralization of live Victoria infection and although neutralization titers were reduced 14-fold against the P.1 variant first discovered in Brazil they remained largely effective. These data demonstrate that the mRNA vaccine platform delivers strong humoral immunity in people up to 96 years of age and retains broad efficacy against the P.1 variant of concern."
Coinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and other respiratory viruses at a tertiary hospital in Korea.,"Background: Studies have reported coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), with other viruses that cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs). We investigated the coinfection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other RTI-causing viruses, and whether the cycle threshold (Ct) value of a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) differed when the coinfection occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 in Daegu, Republic of Korea, in 2020. Methods: After performing PCR for SARS-CoV-2, we additionally tested for the presence of RTI-causing viruses to check for coinfection. Subsequently, we identified the specific coexisting respiratory viruses and calculated the coinfection rate. In addition, based on the coinfection status, we compared the Ct values obtained from RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 PCR. Results: Of 13,717 patients, 123 had positive results on COVID-19 PCR testing and six tested positive for an RTI-causing virus. Thus, the coinfection rate was 4.9%. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR between coinfected and non-coinfected patients. Conclusion: This study computed the coinfection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and RTI-causing viruses and revealed that the mean Ct values in SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR did not differ according to the coinfection status."
Validation of a new automated chemiluminescent anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody assay system detecting both N and S proteins in Japan.,"PCR methods are presently the standard for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but additional methodologies are needed to complement PCR methods, which have some limitations. Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The repeatability and within-laboratory precision were obviously good in validations, following to the CLSI document EP15-A3. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this new automated method for detecting antibody against both N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient for use in laboratory testing."
Chest CT features of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).,"A new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading worldwide and causes pneumonia, respiratory distress, thromboembolic events, and death. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, monitoring disease progression, determination of disease severity, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic. Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provides close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease. Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. Herein, we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion."
The measles outbreak in Israel in 2018-19: lessons for COVID-19 pandemic.,"During 2018-2019 Israel saw some 4300 measles cases in a country-wide epidemic. Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making. In parallel to proper use of COVID-19 vaccines, when available, a 'social vaccine' is crucial as well as preparedness and response according to public health principles."
A structural equation model to examine the clinical features of mild-to-moderate COVID-19: A multicenter Italian study.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a sample of Italian patients and to investigate the occurrence of smell and taste disorders. Infected individuals with suspected (clinical diagnosis) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited. Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms, and smell and taste disorders. A total of 294 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough, and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; P < .001). Smell disorders occurred before the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Interestingly, our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference, either for general symptoms or otorhinolaryngological features, between the clinical diagnosis group and the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction) group. The structural equation model confirmed significant standardized paths (P < .05) between general symptoms, comorbidities, and general otorhinolaryngological complaints in the absence of a significant correlation between these elements and smell and taste alterations. The prevalence of smell and taste disorders in mild-to-moderate Italian COVID-19 patients is significant both in suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases and reveals a strong correlation between these clinical signs regardless of the presence of general or otorhinolaryngological symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea."
Single-Dose Immunization With a Chimpanzee Adenovirus-Based Vaccine Induces Sustained and Protective Immunity Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a global priority. Here, we aim to develop novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on a derivative of less commonly used rare adenovirus serotype AdC68 vector. Three vaccine candidates were constructed expressing either the full-length spike (AdC68-19S) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) with two different signal sequences (AdC68-19RBD and AdC68-19RBDs). Single-dose intramuscular immunization induced robust and sustained binding and neutralizing antibody responses in BALB/c mice up to 40 weeks after immunization, with AdC68-19S being superior to AdC68-19RBD and AdC68-19RBDs. Importantly, immunization with AdC68-19S induced protective immunity against high-dose challenge with live SARS-CoV-2 in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated animals demonstrated dramatic decreases in viral RNA copies and infectious virus in the lungs, as well as reduced lung pathology compared to the control animals. Similar protective effects were also found in rhesus macaques. Taken together, these results confirm that AdC68-19S can induce protective immune responses in experimental animals, meriting further development toward a human vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
A discussion on implementing pooling detection tests of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for a large population.,"A pooled sample analysis strategy for novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)) is proposed for a large population in this paper. The population to be tested is divided into divisions based on earlier observed detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 first. Samples collected are then grouped in appropriate pooled size. The number of tests per person in that population is expressed as a function of two variables: the observed detection rate and the pooled size or number of samples grouped. The minimum number of tests per person can be further shown to be a function of only one of these two variables, because these two parameters are found to be related at this minimum. A management scheme on grouping the samples is proposed in order to reduce the number of tests, to save time, which is of utmost importance in fighting an epidemic. The proposed testing scheme will be useful for supporting the government in making decisions to handle regular routine detection tests for identifying asymptomatic patients and implementing health code system in large population of millions of citizens. Another important point is to use smaller number of test kits, allowing more resources to speed up the mass screening tests, particularly in places not so rich."
Future developments in biosensors for field-ready SARS-CoV-2 virus diagnostics.,"According to the evidence, the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by a zoonotic pathogen named respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus can spread through personal contact, respiratory droplets, and also through airborne transmission. A rapid, low-cost, and effective biosensor platform is essential to diagnose patients with COVID-19 infection, predominantly the asymptomatic individuals, and prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 via transmission routes. The objective of this review is to provide a comparative view among current diagnostic methods, focusing on recently suggested biosensors for the detection of SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples. A capable SARS-CoV-2 biosensor can be designed by the holistic insights of various biosensor studies."
Potential protective role of the anti-PD-1 blockade against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and its global dissemination became the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. In patients undergoing immunotherapy, the effect and path of viral infection remain uncertain. In addition, viral-infected mice and humans show T-cell exhaustion, which is identified after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, they regain their T-cell competence and effectively prevent viral infection when treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Four clinical trials are officially open to evaluate anti-PD-1 antibody administration's effectiveness for cancer and non-cancer individuals influenced by COVID-19 based on these findings. The findings may demonstrate the hypothesis that a winning strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection could be the restoration of exhausted T-cells. In this review, we outline the potential protective function of the anti-PD-1 blockade against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the aim to develop SARS-CoV-2 therapy."
De novo design of new chemical entities for SARS-CoV-2 using artificial intelligence.,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has severely affected the health and economy of several countries. Multiple studies are in progress to design novel therapeutics against the potential target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, including 3CL protease, an essential protein for virus replication. Materials & methods: In this study we employed deep neural network-based generative and predictive models for de novo design of small molecules capable of inhibiting the 3CL protease. The generative model was optimized using transfer learning and reinforcement learning to focus around the chemical space corresponding to the protease inhibitors. Multiple physicochemical property filters and virtual screening score were used for the final screening. Conclusion: We have identified 33 potential compounds as ideal candidates for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2."
"A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, crossover trial to investigate the effect of a wearable device in addition to a daily symptom diary for the remote early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-RED): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","Objectives: It is currently thought that most-but not all-individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms, but that the infectious period starts on average two days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in the blood] or SARS-CoV-2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition) the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. Trial design: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3-month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. Participants: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk individuals and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal, and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal ( www.covid-red.eu ). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: Resident of the Netherlands At least 18 years old Informed consent provided (electronic) Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocol Must have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified) Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria: Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported) Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID-19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self-reported) Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported) Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self-reported) Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported) Pregnant at time of informed consent (self-reported) Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet's User Manual; self-reported) Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID-RED app's underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Main outcomes: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called ""COVID-positive"" mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. Randomisation: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. Blinding (masking): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Trial status: Protocol version: 1.2, dated January 22nd, 2021 Start of recruitment: February 22nd, 2021 End of recruitment (estimated): April 2021 End of follow-up (estimated): December 2021 TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered at the Netherlands Trial Register on the 18th of February, 2021 with number NL9320 ( https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/9320 ) FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol."
Clinical evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antibody tests.,"The aim of this study was to assess the analytic and clinical performance of four rapid lateral flow point-of-care tests (POCTs) for identifying SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. A retrospective study was conducted between 22 January and 30 March 2020 on 132 serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection referred to a tertiary referral hospital laboratory in New South Wales. Multiple sera were tested from 20 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies detected by immunofluorescence (IFA) or neutralisation, and 71 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals. We measured the sensitivity and specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies for each POCT in comparison to positive SARS-CoV-2-specific IFA and viral neutralisation, our current laboratory benchmark tests. All POCTs were found to have a low analytic sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, ranging from 27.3% to 58.2%, with a specificity between 88.3% and 100%, and a low clinical sensitivity from 45% to 65%, with a clinical specificity between 87.3% and 100%. All POCTs had an increased sensitivity when specimens were collected more than 14 days from onset of symptoms. The detection using point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies after disease onset lagged behind IFA by a range of 0-9 days. POCTs promise the benefit of providing quick easy testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. However, their poor sensitivity and delayed antibody detection make them unsuitable as a diagnostic or screening tool alone."
Characterization of humoral response to COVID mRNA vaccines in multiple sclerosis patients on disease modifying therapies.,"Little is known about COVID-19 mRNA vaccine humoral immune responses in patients with central nervous system autoimmune demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO), who are on B-cell depleting therapies (BCDT) and other disease modifying therapies (DMTs). We conducted a single center prospective study to identify the clinical and immunological features associated with vaccine-induced antibody response in 53 participants before and after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. This is the first report on the anti-spike RBD and anti-nucleocapsid antibody response, along with pre- and post-vaccine absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and flow cytometry analysis of CD19 and CD20 lymphocytes in patients with MS and NMO. We tested the hypothesis that patients on BCDT may have impaired COVID-19 vaccine humoral responses. Among patients on BCDT, 36.4% demonstrated a positive antibody response to spike RBD, in comparison to 100% in all other groups such as healthy controls, untreated MS, and patients on non-B cell depleting DMTs (p < 0.0001). Immunological data revealed lower baseline (pre-vaccination) levels of IgM in patients on BCDT (p = 0.003). Low CD19 and CD20 counts and a shorter interval from the last B cell depleting therapy infusion to the first vaccine dose were associated with a negative spike RBD antibody response (non-seroconverter) in patients on BCDT. Age, body mass index (BMI) and total treatment duration did not differ between seroconverters and non-seroconverters."
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from Human to Domestic Ferret.,We report a case of natural infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmitted from an owner to a pet ferret in the same household in Slovenia. The ferret had onset of gastroenteritis with severe dehydration. Whole-genome sequencing of the viruses isolated from the owner and ferret revealed a 2-nt difference.
Initial determination of COVID-19 seroprevalence among outpatients and healthcare workers in Minnesota using a novel SARS-CoV-2 total antibody ELISA.,"Objectives: To avoid the significant risks posed by the use of COVID-19 serology tests with supply chain constraints or poor performance characteristics, we developed an in-house SARS-CoV-2 total antibody test. Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Methods: Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4-69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our test's clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients > 14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity. A screening study was conducted to ascertain COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Results: Analysis of serum collected between April 13 and May 21, 2020 indicated a COVID-19 seroprevalence of 2.96% among 1,282 healthcare workers and 4.46% among 2,379 outpatients. Conclusions: Our in-house SARS-CoV-2 total antibody test can be used to conduct reliable epidemiological studies to inform public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients in Earlier Stages Exhaled Millions of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Per Hour.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhaled millions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA copies per hour, which plays an important role in COVID-19 transmission. Exhaled breath had a higher positive rate (26.9%, n = 52) than surface (5.4%, n = 242) and air (3.8%, n = 26) samples."
The Limited Sensitivity of Chest Computed Tomography Relative to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infection: A Systematic Review on COVID-19 Diagnostics.,"Objectives: Several studies suggest the sensitivity of chest computed tomography (CT) is far greater than that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in diagnosing COVID-19 patients, and therefore, CT should be included as a primary diagnostic tool. This systematic review aims to stratify studies as high or low risk of bias to determine the true sensitivity of CT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection according to the unbiased (low risk) studies, a topic of particular importance given the insufficient quantity of RT-PCR kits in many countries. We focus on sensitivity as that is the chief advantage perceived of CT. Materials and methods: This systematic review involved searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles conducted and published between January 1 and April 15, 2020. The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-97; I = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69-87, I = 89.9%). For chest CT, the mean sensitivity reported by biased studies was 94% (n = 3371 patients/24 studies; 95% CI, 92-96; I = 93.1%), compared with 75% by unbiased studies (n = 957/10 studies; 95% CI, 67-83; I = 89.5%). Conclusions: The difference between the sensitivities of CT and RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is lower than previously thought, as after stratifying the studies, the true sensitivity for CT based on the unbiased studies is limited."
Preoperative computerized tomography screening for COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients: experiences from two centers.,"Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the preoperative screening performance of chest CT (computerized tomography) examination to detect COVID-19 positive individuals. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study 218 adult patients who had preoperative chest CT and RT-PCR were enrolled. CT imaging results, which have been reported according to the Radiological Society of North America expert consensus on COVID-19, were collected from the picture archiving and communicating system. Demographic data, planned surgeries, and postoperative outcomes were collected from the electronic patient records. Results: One patient (0.5%) showed typical CT features for COVID-19 pneumonia; 12 patients (5.5%) were reported as indeterminate, and eight (3.7%) were reported as atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia. Only one of the three patients with positive RT-PCR had abnormalities on CT. When RT-PCR tests were taken as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of chest CT in showing COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients were 33.3%, 90.7%, and 90.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT screening for COVID-19 has a very low yield in asymptomatic preoperative patients and shows false-positive findings in 9.2% of cases, potentially leading to unnecessary postponing of the surgery."
"SARS-CoV-2 multifaceted interaction with human host. Part I: What we have learnt and done so far, and the still unknown realities.","SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is a beta-coronavirus which has 80% genetic homology with SARS-CoV, but displays increased virulence and transmissibility. Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was considered a respiratory virus generally causing a mild disease, only severe and fatal in the elderly and individuals with underlying conditions. Severe illnesses and fatalities were attributed to a cytokine storm, an excessive response from the host immune system. However, with the number of infections over 10 millions and still soaring, the insidious and stealthy nature of the virus has emerged, as it causes a vast array of diverse unexpected symptoms among infected individuals, including the young and healthy. It has become evident that besides infecting the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many organs, possibly through the infection of the endothelium. This review presents an overview of our learning curve with the novel virus emergence, transmission, pathology, biological properties and host-interactions. It also briefly describes remedial measures taken until an effective vaccine is available, that is non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the viral spread and the repurposing of existing drugs, approved or in development for other conditions to eliminate the virus or mitigate the cytokine storm."
COVID-19 and the flu: data simulations and computational modelling to guide public health strategies.,"Background: Pandemics threaten lives and economies. This article addresses the global threat of the anticipated overlap of COVID-19 with seasonal-influenza. Objectives: Scientific evidence based on simulation methodology is presented to reveal the impact of a dual outbreak, with scenarios intended for propagation analysis. This article aims at researchers, clinicians of family medicine, general practice and policy-makers worldwide. The implications for the clinical practice of primary health care are discussed. Current research is an effort to explore new directions in epidemiology and health services delivery. Methods: Projections consisted of machine learning, dynamic modelling algorithms and whole simulations. Input data consisted of global indicators of infectious diseases. Four simulations were run for '20% versus 60% flu-vaccinated populations' and '10 versus 20 personal contacts'. Outputs consisted of numerical values and mathematical graphs. Outputs consisted of numbers for 'never infected', 'vaccinated', 'infected/recovered', 'symptomatic/asymptomatic' and 'deceased' individuals. Peaks, percentages, R0, durations are reported. Results: The best-case scenario was one with a higher flu-vaccination rate and fewer contacts. The reverse generated the worst outcomes, likely to disrupt the provision of vital community services. Both measures were proven effective; however, results demonstrated that 'increasing flu-vaccination rates' is a more powerful strategy than 'limiting social contacts'. Conclusions: Results support two affordable preventive measures: (i) to globally increase influenza-vaccination rates, (ii) to limit the number of personal contacts during outbreaks. The authors endorse changing practices and research incentives towards multidisciplinary collaborations. The urgency of the situation is a call for international health policy to promote interdisciplinary modern technologies in public health engineering."
"Neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike in COVID-19 patients, health care workers, and convalescent plasma donors.","Rapid and specific antibody testing is crucial for improved understanding, control, and treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Herein, we describe and apply a rapid, sensitive, and accurate virus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The assay is based on an HIV-1 lentiviral vector that contains a secreted intron Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) or secreted nano-luciferase reporter cassette, pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, and is validated with a plaque-reduction assay using an authentic, infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain. The assay was used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum from individuals with a broad range of COVID-19 symptoms; patients included those in the intensive care unit (ICU), health care workers (HCWs), and convalescent plasma donors. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were observed among ICU patients, followed by general hospitalized patients, HCWs, and convalescent plasma donors. Our study highlights a wide phenotypic variation in human antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrates the efficacy of a potentially novel lentivirus pseudotype assay for high-throughput serological surveys of neutralizing antibody titers in large cohorts."
Dentistry and the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Introduction: Infection prevention in dental practice is a principle of utmost importance aiming to protect patients, the dental team, and ultimately, public health. The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has instigated worldwide public concern. This highly contagious disease has called for profound changes in patient care around the world. The goal of this article is to review the current literature and introduce essential knowledge about COVID-19, recommend management protocols and adequate protection for dental professionals during the outbreak. Material and methods: The literature search was conducted from April to June 2020. After full-text screening a total of 85 studies were included. Results: Given the novelty of SARS-CoV-2, some characteristics of the virus remain yet unknown. The virus is aerosol-transmissible and, because of the nature of dental procedures, this puts dental professionals and patients at a high risk of contamination by this pathogen. Adequate management protocols and specific protective approaches are essential to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in dental settings during the outbreak. Discussion: The overall impact of COVID-19 in health care worldwide is yet to be determined. This constitutes a significant limitation to this review because the information obtained risks being outdated as the pandemic progresses. The prudent practitioner will use this review as a starting point and continue to proactively update themselves as the outbreak continues. Further studies are required to investigate the potential impact of infections with SARS-CoV-2 within dental settings."
COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality."
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Children: A Case Series From Mayotte Island.,"During the COVID-19 outbreak in the French overseas department Mayotte, 11 children developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). They all had a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Six patients were admitted to intensive care unit; management included intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroid. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was documented in all patients. The risk of developing MIS-C was much higher than in all of France."
A bulletin from Greece: a health system under the pressure of the second COVID-19 wave.,"In this article, we analyze the cascade of events since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Greece, with emphasis on the crisis' management so as to preserve the functionality of the national health system, which remains vulnerable due to the financial recession of the previous decade and chronic shortcomings . We compare and contrast the situation during the first and second epidemic wave. Understanding what possibly went wrong and when, is crucial . Such knowledge provides valuable guidance for the confrontation of the strong second wave that we are currently facing in Europe and other regions around the globe, as well as for the future waves that may follow."
"Current perspective on diagnosis, epidemiological assessment, prevention strategies, and potential therapeutic interventions for severe acute respiratory infections caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).","Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe respiratory, enteric, and systemic infections in a vast range of hosts, including man, fish, mammals, and avian. Scientific interest has heightened on coronaviruses after the emergence of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This review provides current perspectives on morphology, genetic diversity, transmission characteristics, replication cycle, diagnostic approaches, epidemiological assessment, and prevention strategies against the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, different potential biotherapeutics such as small drug molecules, different vaccines, and immunotherapies to control severe acute respiratory infections caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are repurposed and discussed with different mechanistic approaches. The current growth trends of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak globally and preventive measures are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the lessons learned from the COVID-19 outbreak, so far, concluding remarks and future directions for controlling for COVID-19, are also recommended for a safer tomorrow."
Historical Insight into Infections and Disorders Associated with Neurological and Psychiatric Sequelae Similar to Long COVID.,"Long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now recognized. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the terminology for this emerging chronic clinical syndrome, which includes long COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute COVID-19, and long-hauler COVID-19. In this review, I will use the term ""long COVID"". A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in ""brain fog"". Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the ""brain fog"" described in long COVID. During past viral epidemics and pandemics, a commonality of neural targets may have increased viral survival by conformational matching. The neurological and psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or long COVID, may have emerged from neural effects that have emerged from an invertebrate and vertebrate virosphere. This review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long COVID."
[COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory state in a 15-year-old female patient].,"Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Related to SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a rare novel clinical entity observed in children and adolescents with evidence of a recent COVID-19 infection, and is characterized by a marked hyperinflammatory state with involvement of multiple organ systems.We report a case of a previously healthy 15-year-old female patient, who was admitted to paediatric intensive care with cardiac failure and was subsequently shown to have positive COVID-19 serology. The presenting symptoms were fever, cough, chest pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms. She was supported with milrinone and a low dose of vasopressors. Her hyperinflammatory state was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, high dose aspirin and high-dose methylprednisolone. PIMS-TS is a rare, potentially life threatening novel clinical entity in children and adolescents with evidence of a COVID-19 infection. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of this new disease, to ensure prompt recognition and treatment."
Digestive system manifestations and clinical significance of coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic literature review.,"Background and aim: A worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has drawn global attention. Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms ""clinical features,"" ""2019 novel coronavirus,"" ""2019-nCoV,"" ""COVID-19,"" or ""SARS-Cov-2."" Observational studies, case reports, or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viruses in stools were included. Results: A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension, and GI hemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics has been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. Conclusions: GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients. Hygiene protection and keeping the drainpipe free flowing are necessary for everyone."
Clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia treated with corticosteroids and colchicine in Colombia.,"Background: To date, there is no specific antiviral therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Since there is no specific therapy against SARS-CoV2, current efforts aim to prevent contagion through public health measures and develop a protective vaccine. While waiting for the latter, it is necessary to evaluate the drugs that at least, in initial studies, suggested some degree of utility in the management of Covid-19 or its complications. The main objective of the study was to describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with severe Covid-19 Pneumonia treated with corticosteroids and colchicine. Materials and methods: A cross sectional study of 301 adult patients with Covid-19 Pneumonia confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV2 (RT-PCR SARS-CoV2), Berlin protocol, who required hospitalization in three hospitals in Antioquia, Colombia. Patients were treated according to the institutional protocol (from March 20, 2020 to June 30, 2020) with corticosteroid if the patient required supplemental oxygen. From July 1, 2020, the management protocol changed with the addition of colchicine to all patients admitted to the institutions. The treatment was supervised and monitored by the same specialist in Infectology of the institutions. We describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patients who received these treatments. The information of the patients was analyzed according to the outcome of interest (alive/dead) with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate measures to adjust the variables that presented statistical association. Results: All patients had pneumonia documented by chest computed tomography with ground glass images and presented an alveolar pressure/inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. Three hundred one patients were included, 240 (79.7%) received corticosteroids, within these 145 (48.2%) received colchicine also, and the remaining 61 (20.3%) patients did not receive corticosterioids or colchicine. Mortality in the group that received colchicine was lower compared to the group that did not receive it (9.6 vs 14.6%, p-value = 0.179). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids and colchicine for managing patients with severe Covid-19 Pneumonia was associated with low mortality at the hospital level. Randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids and colchicine on complications or death from Covid-19."
Unfolding the Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in China.,"Background: China is at the forefront of global efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines and has five fast-tracked candidates at the final-stage, large-scale human clinical trials testing phase. Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context. Objective: In this study, public opinions in China were analyzed via dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which Chinese netizens' views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination were investigated. We also aimed to develop strategies for promoting vaccination programs in China based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilization. Methods: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context. Results: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R01=1.1360), the revolution period (R02=2.8278), and the transmission period (R03=3.0729). Topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China include price and side effects. From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China. Conclusions: Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of China's involvement with vaccine development. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on netizens' collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policies."
Structure-guided T cell vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that escape convalescent and vaccine-induced antibody responses has renewed focus on the development of broadly protective T-cell-based vaccines. Here, we apply structure-based network analysis and assessments of HLA class I peptide stability to define mutationally constrained CD8+ T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Highly networked residues are conserved temporally among circulating variants and sarbecoviruses and disproportionately impair spike pseudotyped lentivirus infectivity when mutated. Evaluation of HLA class I stabilizing activity for 18 globally prevalent alleles identifies CD8+ T cell epitopes within highly networked regions with limited mutational frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and deep-sequenced primary isolates. Moreover, these epitopes elicit demonstrable CD8+ T cell reactivity in convalescent individuals but reduced recognition in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. These data thereby elucidate key mutationally constrained regions and immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for a global T-cell-based vaccine against emerging variants and SARS-like coronaviruses."
What are the measures taken to prevent COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers? A retrospective study in a cluster of primary care clinics in Singapore.,"Objective: To examine factors contributing to the low COVID-19 infectivity rate among healthcare workers in SingHealth Polyclinics (SHP), Singapore, from February to July 2020. Design: Retrospective description, analysis and discussion of the factors and their contribution. Setting: Single-institution study. Methods: We describe and discuss the healthcare policies, infrastructure, people and processes contributing to the low COVID-19 infectivity rate in SHP.There were 1212 full-time and 198 contract staff. Of these, 171 SHP employees also supported the work in dormitories, isolation and community care facilities. During the review period, healthcare workers (HCWs) in SHP managed about 867 076 patient attendances, including 63 503 for upper respiratory tract infections, across its cluster of eight polyclinics. 29 642 swabs for COVID-19 were performed in SHP, with 126 positive results. 395 swabs were carried out in the dormitories and 59 were positive. Despite the high exposure, only two SHP staff were infected with COVID-19. Both have recovered well. Results: Provision of adequate personal protection equipment, zonal segregation of high-risk patients, reduction in physical patient visits, effective staff communication, implementation of self-declared temperature monitoring and the maintenance of sustainable workload and work hours of HCWs contributed to the mitigation of COVID-19 infection risk among our staff. Conclusions: Until the widespread uptake of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, these measures are important in protecting HCWs. They are also important when managing future pandemics of similar nature to COVID-19."
"Infection, atherothrombosis and thromboembolism beyond the COVID-19 disease: what similar in physiopathology and researches.","The recent Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has led to growing research on the relationship between thromboembolism and Sars-Cov-2 infection. Nowadays, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, coagulation, and inflammatory host immune response are the subject of extensive researches in patients with COVID-19 disease. However, studies on the link between microorganisms or infections and thrombotic or thromboembolic events met fluctuating interest in the past. We, therefore, aimed to briefly summarize previous evidence on this topic, highlighting common points between previous data and what experienced today with SARS-COV2 infections."
Current approaches for target-specific drug discovery using natural compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently caused a pandemic outbreak called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease has initially been reported in China and also now it is expeditiously spreading around the globe directly among individuals through coughing and sneezing. Since it is a newly emerging viral disease and obviously there is a lack of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents, it is urgently required to develop an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2-agent.Through recent advancements in computational biology and biological assays, several natural compounds and their derivatives have been reported to confirm their target specific antiviral potential against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS-CoV).These targets including an important host cell receptor, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2 and several viral proteins e.g. spike glycoprotein (S) containing S1 and S2 domains, SARS CoV Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro), helicases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Due to physical, chemical, and some genetic similarities of SARS CoV-2 with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, repurposing various anti-SARS-COV or anti-MERS-COV natural therapeutic agents could be helpful for the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal medicine. Here we have summarized various drug targets in SARS-COV and MERS-COV using several natural products and their derivatives, which could guide researchers to design and develop a safe and cost-effective anti-SARS-COV-2 drugs."
Testing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy through deliberate natural viral exposure.,"Background: A vaccine trial with a conventional challenge design can be very fast once it starts, but it requires a long prior process, in part to grow and standardize challenge virus in the laboratory. This detracts somewhat from its overall promise for accelerated efficacy testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates, and from the ability of developing countries and small companies to conduct it. Aims: We set out to identify a challenge design that avoids this part of the long prior process. Sources: Literature in trial design (including a proof of concept flu challenge trial by B. Killingley et al.), vaccinology, medical ethics, and various aspects of COVID response. Content: A challenge design with deliberate natural viral exposure avoids the need to grow culture. This new design is described and compared both to a conventional challenge design and to a conventional phase III field trial. In comparison, the proposed design has ethical, scientific, and feasibility strengths. Implications: The proposed new design should be considered for future vaccine trials."
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Attitudes as Expressed in U.S. FDA Public Commentary: Need for a Public-Private Partnership in a Learning Immunization System.,"As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration COVID-19 vaccine review process, public commentary was solicited offering an opportunity to reflect on vaccine attitudes that may impact the uptake of coronavirus vaccines. We identified themes in the commentary that highlighted the safety, efficacy, ethics, and trustworthiness and transparency regarding the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. A ""Learning Immunization System"" model is proposed to optimize public, private, and academic partnerships relating to vaccine development and implementation."
The Experience of Greece as a Model to Contain COVID-19 Infection Spread.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic known as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for the death of more than 2 million people worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat on human lives and public safety. The aim of this review is to describe key aspects of the bio-pathology of the novel disease, and discuss aspects of its spread, as well as targeted protective strategies that can help shape the outcome of the present and future health crises. Greece is used as a model to inhibit SARS-COV-2 spread, since it is one of the countries with the lowest fatality rates among nations of the European Union (E.U.), following two consecutive waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, niche research technological approaches and scientific recommendations that emerged during the COVID-19 era are discussed."
Strategies and Experiences of the Small Laboratory to Cope with the Mass Nucleic Acid Test of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in late 2019, continues to ravage the globe and has become the greatest threat to human health. As nucleic acid test is the primary means of screening for COVID-19, this makes the laboratory the most important node in the epidemic prevention and control system. Methods: As a small laboratory in the hospital, we can meet a large number of demands for nucleic acid test by optimizing staff process, strictly disinfecting experimental batches and changing experimental methods. Results: Through the improvement of the above aspects, our daily maximum detection quantity has been increased from 256/day to 1,012/day. Besides, none of the medical staff has been infected. And there have been no nosocomial infections. Conclusions: Nucleic acid laboratories, especially small laboratories, should promptly adjust their strategies in the face of unexpected outbreaks and conduct risk assessment in accordance with laboratory activities."
Standard blood laboratory values as a clinical support tool to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients.,"Standard blood laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential, if polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests are not available on time. We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. We compared laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups. Of the 590 patients (20-100 years, 276 females and 314 males), 208 were PCR-positive. Positive compared to negative PCR-tested patients had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, C-reactive-protein, ferritin, activated-partial-thromboplastin-time, alanine-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase, lipase, creatine-kinase, and lactate-dehydrogenase. From all blood parameters, eosinophils, ferritin, leukocytes, and erythrocytes showed the highest ability to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (area-under-curve, AUC: 72.3-79.4%). The AUC of our model was 0.915 (95% confidence intervals, 0.876-0.955). Leukopenia, eosinopenia, elevated erythrocytes, and hemoglobin were among the strongest markers regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and post-test probabilities. Our findings suggest that especially leukopenia, eosinopenia, and elevated hemoglobin are helpful to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative tested patients."
Coronavirus discovery by metagenomic sequencing: a tool for pandemic preparedness.,"Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 is a prime example of the omnipresent threat of emerging viruses that can infect humans. A protocol for the identification of novel coronaviruses by viral metagenomic sequencing in diagnostic laboratories may contribute to pandemic preparedness. Aim: The aim of this study is to validate a metagenomic virus discovery protocol as a tool for coronavirus pandemic preparedness. Methods: The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery. Results: Classification of NGS reads using Centrifuge and Genome Detective resulted in assignment of the reads to the closest relatives of the emerging coronaviruses. Low nucleotide and amino acid identity (81% and 84%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2) in combination with up to 98% genome coverage were indicative for a related, novel coronavirus. Capture probes targeting vertebrate viruses, designed in 2015, enhanced both sequencing depth and coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the latter increasing from 71% to 98%. Conclusion: The model used for simulation of virus discovery enabled validation of the metagenomic sequencing protocol. The metagenomic protocol with virus probes designed before the pandemic, can assist the detection and identification of novel coronaviruses directly in clinical samples."
Cross-disciplinary approaches to assist with nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"Improving the capacity of detecting positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is critical for identifying the infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) precisely and thereby curbing the pandemic. Cross-disciplinary approaches may improve the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis by compensating to some extent the limitations encountered by traditional test methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining computed tomography (CT), serum-specific antibody detection, and nanopore sequencing with nucleic acid testing for individual testing may improve the accuracy of identifying COVID-19 patients. At community or even regional/national levels, the combination of pooled screening and spatial epidemiological strategies may enable the detection of early transmission of epidemics in a cost-effective way, which is also less affected by restricted access to diagnostic tests and kit supplies. This would significantly advance our capacity of curbing epidemics as soon as possible, and better prepare us for entering a new era of high-impact and high-frequency epidemics."
Air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room.,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a target cell receptor for internalization and proliferation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). When ACE2-highly expressed tissues are manipulated, SARS-CoV-2 containing aerosols may be generated. Normal breathing and speaking are capable of producing aerosols so mask ventilation, suction of airway tract and bucking during tracheal intubation and extubation are clinical procedures capable of significant aerosol production. Whilst no data have been reported on the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room (OR), contamination in the OR can be estimated from the intensive care unit (ICU) data. ICU data showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected on all types of surface and in air within about 4 m from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. High concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the personal protective equipment (PPE) removal room and medical staff office. Submicron virus-laden aerosols could result from resuspension of particles containing SARS-CoV-2 sticking the PPE surface; removal could produce the initial velocity. Supermicron virus-laden aerosol could come from floor deposited SARS-CoV-2, which were carried across different areas by medical staff (e.g., shoe). Knowledge of aerosol generation and distribution in the OR will aid the design of strategies to reduce transmission risk."
Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review.,"Objective: To evaluate systematically the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, China Biomedical Literature Service System, and China Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to December 31, 2020. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the quality of studies. A qualitative analysis was performed on the results of clinical trials. Results: Thirteen randomized, blinded, controlled trials, which involved the safety and efficacy of 11 COVID-19 vaccines, were included. In 10 studies, the 28-day seroconversion rate of subjects exceeded 80%. In two 10 000-scale clinical trials, the vaccines were effective in 95% and 70.4% of the subjects, respectively. The seroconversion rate was lower than 60% in only one study. In six studies, the proportion of subjects who had an adverse reaction within 28 days after vaccination was lower than 30%. This proportion was 30%-50% in two studies and > 50% in the other two studies. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate and resolved within 24 hours after vaccination. The most common local adverse reaction was pain or tenderness at the injection site, and the most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue, fever, or bodily pain. The immune response and incidence of adverse reactions to the vaccines were positively correlated with the dose given to the subjects. The immune response to the vaccines was worse in the elderly than in the younger population. In 6 studies that compared single-dose and double-dose vaccination, 4 studies showed that double-dose vaccination produced a stronger immune response than single-dose vaccination. Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective and safe. Double-dose vaccination is recommended. However, more research is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccines and the influence of dose, age, and production process on the protective efficacy."
Walking the Tightrope: Reevaluating science communication in the era of COVID-19 vaccines.,"Scientists are trained to be skeptical and not overstate the existing evidence. This cautiousness is a valuable asset when working in scientific research, where the goal is the pursuit of knowledge and truth. It becomes a handicap when scientists are asked to communicate to the public about pressing topics such as COVID-19 vaccines. Often in such contexts, immediate recommendations are sought, and decisions must be made even when complete evidence is lacking. For scientists to be effective public communicators, they must adjust their mindset and embrace brevity, clarity, and other principles of effective communication. Focusing messages on what is known fosters public confidence in taking needed actions, whereas focusing on what is still unknown fosters inaction and seeds doubt. The implementation of principles of effective communication does not inherently conflict with maintaining scientific accuracy and acknowledging uncertainty, but it does require additional care, effort, and training."
Multiplexing primer/probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR.,"Background: The novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for over 380,000 COVID-19 related deaths, has caused significant strain on healthcare infrastructure and clinical laboratories globally. The pandemic's initial challenges include broad diagnostic testing, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment. In early 2020, primer/probe sets distributed by the CDC utilized the same fluorophore for molecular detection - requiring multiple assays to be run in parallel - consuming valuable and limited resources. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to UW Virology for SARS-CoV-2 clinical testing were extracted, amplified by our laboratory developed test (LDT) - a CDC-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR reaction - and analyzed for agreement between the multiplexed assay. Laboratory- confirmed respiratory infection samples were included to evaluate assay cross-reaction specificity. Results: Triplexing correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 98.4% of confirmed positive or inconclusive patient samples by single-plex LDT (n = 183/186). All 170 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples tested by single-plex LDT were negative by triplexing. Other laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections did not amplify for SARS-CoV-2 in the triplex reaction. Conclusions: Multiplexing two virus-specific gene targets and an extraction control was found to be comparable to running parallel assays independently, while significantly improving assay throughput."
Chimeric synthetic reference standards enable cross-validation of positive and negative controls in SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests.,"DNA synthesis in vitro has enabled the rapid production of reference standards. These are used as controls, and allow measurement and improvement of the accuracy and quality of diagnostic tests. Current reference standards typically represent target genetic material, and act only as positive controls to assess test sensitivity. However, negative controls are also required to evaluate test specificity. Using a pair of chimeric A/B RNA standards, this allowed incorporation of positive and negative controls into diagnostic testing for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The chimeric standards constituted target regions for RT-PCR primer/probe sets that are joined in tandem across two separate synthetic molecules. Accordingly, a target region that is present in standard A provides a positive control, whilst being absent in standard B, thereby providing a negative control. This design enables cross-validation of positive and negative controls between the paired standards in the same reaction, with identical conditions. This enables control and test failures to be distinguished, increasing confidence in the accuracy of results. The chimeric A/B standards were assessed using the US Centres for Disease Control real-time RT-PCR protocol, and showed results congruent with other commercial controls in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This chimeric reference standard design approach offers extensive flexibility, allowing representation of diverse genetic features and distantly related sequences, even from different organisms."
Projecting the Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Variants and the Vaccination Program on the Fourth Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea.,"Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are currently administered in South Korea; however, vaccine supply is limited. Considering constraints in vaccine supply and the emergence of variant strains, we evaluated the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination program in reducing incidence, ICU hospitalization, and deaths in South Korea. We developed an age-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameterized with Korean demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Using our model, we analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 vaccination program during the fourth wave of the pandemic in South Korea in reducing disease burden. We projected that the vaccination program can reduce the overall attack rate to 3.9% from 6.9% without vaccination, over 150 days, starting from 5 July 2021. The highest relative reduction (50%) was observed among individuals aged 50-59 years. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, such as ICU hospitalizations and deaths, decreasing them by 45% and 43%, respectively. In the presence of the Delta variant, vaccination is expected to reduce the overall attack rate to 11.9% from 26.9%. Our results indicate that the impact of vaccination can be substantially affected by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, herd immunity is unlikely to be achieved with the potential emergence of the Delta variant, inconsistent with the blueprint of the South Korean government."
"Investigation of an outbreak of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7 infection in healthcare workers, Italy.","Objectives: In December 2020, Italy began a national immunization campaign using the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine, prioritizing healthcare workers (HCWs). Immune serum from vaccinated subjects seems (largely) to retain titres of neutralizing antibodies, even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 infection in three HCWs in a hospital setting; two of the HCWs were fully vaccinated (i.e. had received two doses). Methods: Two physicians and one nurse working on the same shift on 20th February 2021 were involved in the outbreak. Real-time PCR, antigen tests, and serological tests for the IgG anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were performed, along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all three HCWs; all presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19. The two physicians were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE). Conclusions: This mini-outbreak highlights some important issues about the efficacy of vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the high risk of exposure among HCWs, and the need for optimized implementation of PPE in hospitals. The wide circulation of VOC 202012/01 in Europe and Italy highlights the need to improve surveillance and genetic sequencing."
Rapid adaptation and continuous performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 envelope gene (E-gene) real-time RT-PCR assays to support the hospital surge in test demand.,"We describe the timely adaption of both published WHO E-gene protocol and commercially available LightMix Modular E-gene assay to the test platform (ABI 7900 Fast real-time analyzer and TaqMan Fast One-step Virus Master Mix) available in an accredited tertiary hospital laboratory with an on-going evaluation to ensure the provision of quality service within the time constraint. The LightMix Modular E-gene was slightly more sensitive when compared to the WHO E-gene, both analytically and diagnostically. The assay was recommended for screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the availability of technically competent staff through continuous training, the provision of round-the-clock service is feasible despite the test is of high complexity. The thermal cycling duration of the adapted LightMix E-gene and WHO E-gene is shortened by half and one hour respectively and allows the number of runs to double when 24-h round-the-clock service is provided. An increase in testing capacity could support surges in testing demand, which is essential to control the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to prevent potential overwhelming of the healthcare system, and to optimize utilization of the isolation beds."
Carbohydrate binding module-fused antibodies improve the performance of cellulose-based lateral flow immunoassays.,"Since the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 in December 2019, several lateral flow assay (LFA) devices were developed to enable the constant monitoring of regional and global infection processes. Additionally, innumerable lateral flow test devices are frequently used for determination of different clinical parameters, food safety, and environmental factors. Since common LFAs rely on non-biodegradable nitrocellulose membranes, we focused on their replacement by cellulose-composed, biodegradable papers. We report the development of cellulose paper-based lateral flow immunoassays using a carbohydrate-binding module-fused to detection antibodies. Studies regarding the protein binding capacity and potential protein wash-off effects on cellulose paper demonstrated a 2.7-fold protein binding capacity of CBM-fused antibody fragments compared to the sole antibody fragment. Furthermore, this strategy improved the spatial retention of CBM-fused detection antibodies to the test area, which resulted in an enhanced sensitivity and improved overall LFA-performance compared to the naked detection antibody. CBM-assisted antibodies were validated by implementation into two model lateral flow test devices (pregnancy detection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies). The CBM-assisted pregnancy LFA demonstrated sensitive detection of human gonadotropin (hCG) in synthetic urine and the CBM-assisted Covid-19 antibody LFA was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in serum. Our findings pave the way to the more frequent use of cellulose-based papers instead of nitrocellulose in LFA devices and thus potentially improve the sustainability in the field of POC diagnostics."
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): An updated review based on current knowledge and existing literature for dermatologists.,"The world entered the year 2020 with reports of the emergence of a new viral illness in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to be the causative novel coronavirus for the cluster of patients suffering from pneumonia in China. The disease was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Several studies, since then, have tried to study and explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its structure and pathogenicity, epidemiology, modes of transmission, spectrum of illness and causes of mortality and morbidity. The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications. With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope. This review intends to cover the current known aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-19, based on the available literature."
The epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID-19 in children: Moroccan experience of the Cheikh Khalifa University Center.,"Introduction: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus. The first cases were identified in Wuhan. It rapidly spread causing a pandemic worldwide. The incidence and severity of this disease are likely to be different in children compared with adults. Few publications of COVID-19 in children have been published. Our Moroccan paediatric series is among the first studies on this disease in Africa. Methods: We included all children with COVID-19 who were admitted and treated at the hospital from March 25 to April 26, 2020. We have collected information, including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory results, treatments and clinical progress from patients with COVID-19. Results: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Morocco, a total of 145 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported in the Cheikh Khalifa's Hospital. Among this cases, 15 children were registered. The median age of patients was 13 years. There were 7 boys and 8 girls. Five children are asymptomatic, 8 have mild symptoms and 2 have a moderate respiratory difficulty. The RT-PCR test results were positive in all patients. Radiologically, we found in 2 cases, multiple nodules with ground-glass opacities on the chest scan. The treatment was based on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Evolution under treatment was good for all patients. Conclusion: This study describes the profile of COVID-19 in child in a Moroccan hospital and confirms that the severity of illness in children with COVID-19 to be far less than adults."
Parents' willingness to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children in the United States.,"Differences in obtaining a vaccine vary based on a multitude of factors including perceptions of vaccine safety, efficacy and willingness to pay (WTP). This study focuses on parent perceptions toward a vaccine for COVID-19 including their WTP decisions for their children and themselves. A mixed methods design using a cross-sectional survey was used to assess the perceptions of US parents, with children under 18, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was administered online in November 2020 and 584 final responses were collected. The questionnaire consisted of approximately 37 closed and open-ended questions regarding personal background information; awareness, knowledge, and experience of the virus; perception toward vaccines and COVID-19; and the contingent valuation of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. WTP was found to be higher for children and a direct relationship between the number of children and WTP was observed. Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses. WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is crucial to determine the partial benefits of vaccinating to reduce the risk of repetitive widespread outbreaks."
Natural versus Recombinant Viral Antigens in SARS-CoV-2 Serology: Challenges in Optimizing Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Objectives: COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern whose detection in recovered asymptomatic patients is dependent on accurate diagnosis as it enables the estimation of the susceptibility of the population to the infection. This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. Methods: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Results: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusion: The choice of antigen is an important aspect in optimizing the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of rNP ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies seems promising, but comparison of the results with those of WVA ELISA is crucial for accurate test development prior to commercialization. IgG serology using several assays, and with the spectral patterns of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in confusing information that must be clarified before the establishment of diagnostic serology criteria."
A SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) biological network to find targets for drug repurposing.,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs a fast recognition of effective drugs to save lives. In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases."
Predicting the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Using Graph Theory-Based Neural Networks.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt."
Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With and Without Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,"Importance: Published data suggest that there are increased hospitalizations, placental abnormalities, and rare neonatal transmission among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described. Results: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women."
Exploring the magic bullets to identify Achilles' heel in SARS-CoV-2: Delving deeper into the sea of possible therapeutic options in Covid-19 disease: An update.,"The symptoms associated with Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in severe conditions can cause multiple organ failure and fatality via a plethora of mechanisms, and it is essential to discover the efficacious and safe drug. For this, a successful strategy is to inhibit in different stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and host cell reactions. The current review briefly put forth the summary of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and highlight the critical areas of understanding in genomics, proteomics, medicinal chemistry, and natural products derived drug discovery. The review further extends to briefly put forth the updates in the drug testing system, biologics, biophysics, and their advances concerning SARS-CoV-2. The salient features include information on SARS-CoV-2 morphology, genomic characterization, and pathophysiology along with important protein targets and how they influence the drug design and development against SARS-CoV-2 and a concerted and integrated approach to target these stages. The review also gives the status of drug design and discovery to identify the drugs acting on critical targets in SARS-CoV-2 and host reactions to treat Covid-19."
COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Among Healthcare Workers and Non-healthcare Workers in China: A Survey.,"Background: The coronavirus pneumonia is still spreading around the world. Much progress has been made in vaccine development, and vaccination will become an inevitable trend in the fight against this pandemic. However, the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination still remains uncertain. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was used in Wen Juan Xing survey platform. All the respondents were divided into healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the key sociodemographic, cognitive, and attitude associations among the samples of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Results: A total of 2,580 respondents completed the questionnaire, including 1,329 healthcare workers and 1,251 non-healthcare workers. This study showed that 76.98% of healthcare workers accepted the COVID-19 vaccine, 18.28% workers were hesitant, and 4.74% workers were resistant. Among the non-healthcare workers, 56.19% workers received the COVID-19 vaccine, 37.57% workers were hesitant, and 6.24% workers were resistant. Among the healthcare workers, compared with vaccine recipients, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12-2.07); vaccine-resistant individuals were more likely to live in the suburbs (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.44-3.99) with an income of 10,000 RMB or greater (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.03-3.90). Among the non-healthcare workers, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31-2.11); vaccine-resistant individuals were also more likely to be female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.16-3.02) and older than 65 years (AOR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.40-7.62). There are great differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in their cognition and attitude toward vaccines. Conclusions: Our study shows that healthcare workers are more willing to be vaccinated than non-healthcare workers. Current vaccine safety issues continue to be a major factor affecting public acceptance, and to expand vaccine coverage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate vaccination strategies and immunization programs are essential, especially for non-healthcare workers."
Is saliva a reliable biofluid for the detection of COVID-19?,"This review aimed to assess the current evidence on the diagnostic potential of saliva regarding the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The literature published until May 24, 2020 was searched in the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar databases with the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""oral fluid"", ""saliva"", and ""diagnosis"", individually and in combination, and 11 studies that explored the efficacy of saliva in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in different patient groups were found. Together, these studies suggest that saliva is a safe and reliable tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Further, saliva offers enhanced safety as well as logistical and economic benefits as compared to the current methods used to diagnose COVID-19. However, there is still limited evidence in the literature to make a definitive, clinically appropriate decision. The ideal specimen for the detection of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still an issue under investigation. Thus, new studies with large sample sets for the validation of easy, safe and reliable methods applicable for large-scale testing are immediately required."
Insights into neutralizing antibody responses in individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Chile.,"Chile has one of the worst numbers worldwide in terms of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and COVID-19-related deaths per million inhabitants; thus, characterization of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in the general population is critical to understanding of immunity at the local level. Given our inability to perform massive classical neutralization assays due to the scarce availability of BSL-3 facilities in the country, we developed and fully characterized an HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, which was used in a 96-well plate format to investigate NAb responses in samples from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with convalescent plasma. We also identified samples with decreased or enhanced neutralization activity against the D614G spike variant compared with the wild type, indicating the relevance of this variant in host immunity. The data presented here represent the first insights into NAb responses in individuals from Chile, serving as a guide for future studies in the country."
SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency: The Importance of Diagnostic Methods.,"Background: Currently, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is underway, resulting in high morbidity and mortality across the globe. Summary: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options."
"A review: Epidemiology, pathogenesis and prospect in developing vaccines for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).","In December 2019, a large number of coronavirus cases were emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and rapidly spread to different countries and territories around the world within four months. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak as a global health emergency. The spread of COVID-19 over globe is highly contagious; they transmitted from person-to-person through small droplets of infected person. Many diagnosis and treatment methods have been implemented to reduce and control the outbreak. Efforts have been made to develop coronavirus vaccine against S protein or spike glycoprotein of coronavirus. COVID-19 outbreak will affect the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the world. At the time of preparing manuscript, total number of active cases reaches to more than 8.9 million and confirmed death reaches to approx. 4.6 lakh. This article highlights the ongoing research and advances in designing vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19 and also focusing on the epidemiology, transmission, future direction and control the spread of infectious diseases."
Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neuropathological alterations: Similarities with other coronaviruses.,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China, and spread quickly around the world. In addition to fever, cough and shortness of breath, it was confirmed that the patients also have manifestations towards the central nervous system (CNS), especially those critically ill ones. In this review, we will discuss how SARS-CoV-2 gain access to the CNS and the possible consequences. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be found in the brain and mediate the disease process. Both direct attack of SARS-CoV-2 and the abnormal immune response in the CNS would contribute to the disease. Also, there is a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular diseases."
Safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (CHESS2101): A multicenter study.,"Background & aims: The development of COVID-19 vaccines has progressed with encouraging safety and efficacy data. Concerns have been raised about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study aimed to explore the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in NAFLD. Methods: This multicenter study included patients with NAFLD without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients were vaccinated with 2 doses of inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and overall incidence of adverse reactions within 28 days, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response at least 14 days after the whole-course vaccination. Results: A total of 381 patients with pre-existing NAFLD were included from 11 designated centers in China. The median age was 39.0 years (IQR 33.0-48.0 years) and 179 (47.0%) were male. The median BMI was 26.1 kg/m2 (IQR 23.8-28.1 kg/m2). The number of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and adverse reactions within 28 days totaled 95 (24.9%) and 112 (29.4%), respectively. The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain in 70 (18.4%), followed by muscle pain in 21 (5.5%), and headache in 20 (5.2%). All adverse reactions were mild and self-limiting, and no grade 3 adverse reactions were recorded. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 364 (95.5%) patients with NAFLD. The median neutralizing antibody titer was 32 (IQR 8-64), and the neutralizing antibody titers were maintained. Conclusions: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in patients with NAFLD. Lay summary: The development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressed rapidly, with encouraging safety and efficacy data. This study now shows that the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
The biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: multiple targets for host-directed antiviral therapy.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19), represents a far more serious threat to public health than SARS and MERS coronaviruses, due to its ability to spread more efficiently than its predecessors. Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (""corona"") and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. This review highlights aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis that may be amenable to host-directed antiviral targeting."
Translational control of coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses represent a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that infect a large spectrum of animals. In humans, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic and is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. All viruses described to date entirely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of the host cells to produce proteins required for their replication and spread. As such, virus often need to control the cellular translational apparatus to avoid the first line of the cellular defense intended to limit the viral propagation. Thus, coronaviruses have developed remarkable strategies to hijack the host translational machinery in order to favor viral protein production. In this review, we will describe some of these strategies and will highlight the role of viral proteins and RNAs in this process."
Stringent thresholds in SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays lead to under-detection of mild infections.,"Background: Thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays have typically been determined using samples from symptomatic, often hospitalised, patients. In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear. Methods: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds. Results: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6-92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9-82.7%). Conclusion: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10-30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results. While lowered diagnostic thresholds may result in unacceptable specificity, our findings have implications for epidemiological analyses and result interpretation in individuals with a high pre-test probability. Samples from mild PCR-confirmed infections should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations."
COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccines Update on Challenges and Resolutions.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a positive-stranded RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the Coronaviridae family. This virus originated in Wuhan City, China, and became the cause of a multiwave pandemic that has killed 3.46 million people worldwide as of May 22, 2021. The havoc intensified with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7; Alpha, B.1.351; Beta, P.1; Gamma, B.1.617; Delta, B.1.617.2; Delta-plus, B.1.525; Eta, and B.1.429; Epsilon etc.) due to mutations generated during replication. More variants may emerge to cause additional pandemic waves. The most promising approach for combating viruses and their emerging variants lies in prophylactic vaccines. Several vaccine candidates are being developed using various platforms, including nucleic acids, live attenuated virus, inactivated virus, viral vectors, and protein-based subunit vaccines. In this unprecedented time, 12 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been phased in following WHO approval, 184 are in the preclinical stage, and 100 are in the clinical development process. Many of them are directed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein (S) to inhibit viral entry through the ACE-2 receptor of host cells. Inactivated vaccines, to the contrary, provide a wide range of viral antigens for immune activation. Being an intracellular pathogen, the cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell (CTL) response remains crucial for all viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be explored in detail. In this review, we try to describe and compare approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are currently being distributed either after phase III clinical trials or for emergency use. We discuss immune responses induced by various candidate vaccine formulations; their benefits, potential limitations, and effectiveness against variants; future challenges, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); and vaccine safety issues and their possible resolutions. Most of the current vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2 are showing either promising or compromised efficacy against new variants. Multiple antigen-based vaccines (multivariant vaccines) should be developed on different platforms to tackle future variants. Alternatively, recombinant BCG, containing SARS-CoV-2 multiple antigens, as a live attenuated vaccine should be explored for long-term protection. Irrespective of their efficacy, all vaccines are efficient in providing protection from disease severity. We must insist on vaccine compliance for all age groups and work on vaccine hesitancy globally to achieve herd immunity and, eventually, to curb this pandemic."
COVID-19 vaccination in haematology patients: an Australian and New Zealand consensus position statement.,"Australia and New Zealand have achieved excellent community control of COVID-19 infection. In light of the imminent COVID-19 vaccination roll out in both countries, representatives from the Haematology Society of Australia and New Zealand and infectious diseases specialists have collaborated on this consensus position statement regarding COVID-19 vaccination in patients with haematological disorders. It is our recommendation that patients with haematological malignancies, and some benign haematological disorders, should have expedited access to high-efficacy COVID-19 vaccines, given that these patients are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. Vaccination should not replace other public health measures in these patients, given that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination, specifically in patients with haematological malignancies, is not known. Given the limited available data, prospective collection of safety and efficacy data of COVID-19 vaccination in this patient group is a priority."
"Can Host Cell Proteins Like ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2, Androgen Receptor be the Efficient Targets in SARS-CoV-2 Infection?","A novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- -2), which caused a large disease outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is currently spreading across the world. Along with binding of the virus spike with the host cell receptor, fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes is a critical step in establishing successful infection of SARS-CoV-2. In this entry process, a diversity of host cell proteases and androgen receptor play a very important role directly or indirectly. These features of SARS-CoV-2 entry contribute to its rapid spread and severe symptoms, high fatality rates among infected patients. This review is based on the latest published literature including review articles, research articles, hypothetical manuscript, preprint articles and official documents. The literature search was made from various published papers on physiological aspects relevant to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we focus on the role of host cell proteases (ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2) and androgen receptor (AR) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hypotheses put forth by us are based on the role played by the proteases ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2 and AR in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were deduced based on various studies. We have also summarized how these host proteins increase the pathology and the infective ability of SARS-CoV-2 and we posit that their inhibition may be a therapeutic option for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection."
The Appropriate Use of Testing for COVID-19.,"Many public officials are calling for increased testing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and some governments have taken extraordinary measures to increase the availability of testing. However, little has been published about the sensitivity and specificity of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs that are commonly used for testing. This narrative review evaluates the literature regarding the accuracy of these tests, and makes recommendations based on this literature. In brief, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19. Thus, over-reliance on the results of the test may be dangerous, and the push for widespread testing may be overstated."
"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A mathematical modelling analysis.","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for < 20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning."
"COVID-19 vaccines - less obfuscation, more transparency and action.",Letter by Venter et al. on editorial by Schoub (Dial down the rhetoric over COVID-19 vaccines. S Afr Med J 2021;111(6):522-523. https://doi.org/10.7196/SAMJ.2021.v111i6.15740).
"Science, religion and state: a multidimensional perspective.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) does not discriminate; it affects everyone regardless of beliefs, gender, nationality, skin color, and social class. A recent correspondence published in the Journal of Public Health proposed the 'collaboration of science and religion in COVID-19 vaccine promotion.' The said article was in response to a previously published correspondence, which proposed a multi-sectoral approach on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination hesitancy. This article further adds that science, religion and state are not mutually exclusive with each other. What this article, therefore, proposes is a multidimensional relationship of science, religion and state to promote the COVID-19 vaccine and other science-based findings to combat the public fear of the public on vaccine and virus."
"Real-Time Genomics for Tracking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Border Incursions after Virus Elimination, New Zealand.","Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first eliminated in New Zealand in May 2020, a total of 13 known coronavirus disease (COVID-19) community outbreaks have occurred, 2 of which led health officials to issue stay-at-home orders. These outbreaks originated at the border via isolating returnees, airline workers, and cargo vessels. Because a public health system was informed by real-time viral genomic sequencing and complete genomes typically were available within 12 hours of community-based positive COVID-19 test results, every outbreak was well-contained. A total of 225 community cases resulted in 3 deaths. Real-time genomics were essential for establishing links between cases when epidemiologic data could not do so and for identifying when concurrent outbreaks had different origins."
"Insights to SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, pathophysiology, and rationalized treatments that target COVID-19 clinical complications.","Background: Gaining further insights into SARS-CoV-2 routes of infection and the underlying pathobiology of COVID-19 will support the design of rational treatments targeting the life cycle of the virus and/or the adverse effects (e.g., multi-organ collapse) that are triggered by COVID-19-mediated adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or other pathologies. Main body: COVID-19 is a two-phase disease being marked by (phase 1) increased virus transmission and infection rates due to the wide expression of the main infection-related ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L human genes in tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, as well as by (phase 2) host- and probably sex- and/or age-specific uncontrolled inflammatory immune responses which drive hyper-cytokinemia, aggressive inflammation and (due to broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2) collateral tissue damage and systemic failure likely because of imbalanced ACE/ANGII/AT1R and ACE2/ANG(1-7)/MASR axes signaling. Conclusion: Here we discuss SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and a number of approaches aiming to suppress viral infection rates or propagation; increase virus antigen presentation in order to activate a robust and durable adaptive immune response from the host, and/or mitigate the ARDS-related ""cytokine storm"" and collateral tissue damage that triggers the severe life-threatening complications of COVID-19."
Factors influencing Covid-19 vaccine acceptance across subgroups in the United States: Evidence from a conjoint experiment.,"Public health officials warn that the greatest barrier to widespread vaccination against Covid-19 will not be scientific or technical, but the considerable public hesitancy to take a novel vaccine. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance is critical to informing public health campaigns aiming to combat public fears and ensure broad uptake. Employing a conjoint experiment embedded on an online survey of almost 2,000 adult Americans, we show that the effects of seven vaccine attributes on subjects' willingness to vaccinate vary significantly across subgroups. Vaccine efficacy was significantly more influential on vaccine acceptance among whites than among Blacks, while bringing a vaccine to market under a Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization had a stronger adverse effect on willingness to vaccinate among older Americans and women. Democrats were more sensitive to vaccine efficacy than Republicans, and both groups responded differently to various endorsements of the vaccine. We also explored whether past flu vaccination history, attitudes toward general vaccine safety, and personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 can explain variation in group vaccination hesitancy. Many subgroups that exhibit the greatest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy did not report significantly lower frequencies of flu vaccination. Several groups that exhibited greater Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy also reported greater concerns about vaccine safety generally, but others did not. Finally, subgroup variation in reported personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 did not strongly match subgroup variation in vaccine acceptance."
The rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to hospital for delivery: Experience of a pandemic center in Turkey.,"Objective: To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to hospital for delivery in a Turkish pandemic center. Study design: This prospective cohort study was conducted in Ankara City Hospital between April, 15, 2020 and June, 5, 2020. A total of 206 asymptomatic pregnant women (103 low-risk pregnant women without any defined risk factor and 103 high-risk pregnant women) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 positivity upon admission to hospital for delivery. Detection of SARS-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was performed by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method targeting RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results: Three of the 206 pregnant women participating in the study had positive RT-PCR tests (1.4 %) and all positive cases were in the high-risk pregnancy group. Although, one case in the high-risk pregnancy group had developed symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19, two repeated RT-PCR tests were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate was significantly higher in the high-risk pregnancy group (2.9 % vs 0%, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Healthcare professionals should be cautious in the labor and delivery of high-risk pregnant women during the pandemic period and universal testing for COVID-19 may be considered in selected populations."
"Routine testing of close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases - National COVID-19 Contact Management Programme, Ireland, May to August 2020.","Objectives: The objective of this study was to inform public health practitioners who are designing, adapting and implementing testing and tracing strategies for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) control. Study design: The study design is monitoring and evaluation of a national public health protection programme. Methods: All close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified between the 19th May and 2nd August were included; secondary attack rates and numbers needed to test were estimated. Results: Four thousand five hundred eighty six of 7272 (63%) close contacts of cases were tested with at least one test. The secondary attack rate in close contacts who were tested was 7% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.3 - 7.8%). At the 'day 0' test, 14.6% (95% CI: 11.6-17.6%) of symptomatic close contacts tested positive compared with 5.2% (95% CI: 4.4-5.9%) of asymptomatic close contacts. Conclusions: The application of additional symptom-based criteria for testing in this high-incidence population (close contacts) is of limited utility because of the low negative predictive value of absence of symptoms."
Safety and Reactogenicity of 2 Doses of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.,"Background: We studied the safety and reactogenicity SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in transplant recipients because immunosuppressed patients were excluded from vaccine trials. Methods: US transplant recipients were recruited into this prospective cohort study through social media; those who completed the full vaccine series between December 9, 2020 and March 1, 2021 were included. We collected demographics, medical history, and safety information within 7 d after doses 1 and 2 (D1, D2). Associations between characteristics and reactions were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. Results: We studied 741 transplant recipients who underwent BNT162b2 (54%) or mRNA-1273 (46%) vaccination. Median (interquartile range) age was 60 (44-69) y, 57% were female, and 10% were non-White. Although local site reactions decreased after D2 (85% D1 versus 78% D2, P < 0.001), systemic reactions increased (49% D1 versus 69% D2, P < 0.001). Younger participants were more likely to develop systemic symptoms after D1 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per 10 y = 0.850.900.94, P < 0.001) and D2 (aIRR per 10 y = 0.910.930.96, P < 0.001). Participants who experienced pain (aIRR = 1.111.662.47, P = 0.01) or redness (aIRR = 1.833.928.41, P < 0.01) were more likely to develop an antibody response to D1 of mRNA vaccines. No anaphylaxis, neurologic diagnoses, or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. Infections were minimal (3% after D1, <0.01% after D2). One patient reported incident acute rejection post-D2. Conclusions: In solid organ transplant recipients undergoing mRNA vaccination, reactogenicity was similar to that reported in the original trials. Severe reactions were rare. These early safety data may help address vaccine hesitancy in transplant recipients."
SARS-CoV-2 spike therapeutic antibodies in the age of variants.,"Christos Kyratsous, Vice President of Research, Infectious Diseases, and Viral Vector Technologies at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Alina Baum, Associate Director, Infectious Diseases Associate at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, discuss the development of antibody therapeutics targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2."
Triage process for the assessment of coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients with cancer: The ONCOVID prospective study.,"Background: Patients with cancer are considered at high risk for the novel respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). General measures to keep COVID-19-free cancer divisions have been adopted worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of triage to identify COVID-19 among patients with cancer. Methods: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, data were collected from patients who were treated or followed at the authors' institution in a prospective clinical trial. The primary endpoint was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-positive patients who were identified using a triage process through the aid of medical and patient questionnaires. Based on a diagnostic algorithm, patients with suspect symptoms underwent an infectious disease specialist's evaluation and a COVID-19 swab. Serologic tests were proposed for patients who had symptoms or altered laboratory tests that did not fall into the diagnostic algorithm but were suspicious for COVID-19. Results: Overall, 562 patients were enrolled. Six patients (1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (67%) had the disease detected through telehealth triage, and 2 patients (33%) without suspect symptoms at triage had the disease detected later. Seventy-one patients (13%) had suspect symptoms and/or altered laboratory tests that were not included in the diagnostic algorithm and, of these, 47 patients (73%) underwent testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: 6 (13%) were positive for IgG (n = 5) or for both IgM and IgG (n = 1), and antibody tests were negative in the remaining 41 patients. Conclusions: The triage process had a positive effect on the detection of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. Telehealth triage was helpful in detecting suspect patients and to keep a COVID-19-free cancer center. The overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (1%) and antibody positivity (13%) in patients with suspect symptoms was similar to that observed in the general population."
"Evidence of central nervous system infection and neuroinvasive routes, as well as neurological involvement, in the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a significant and urgent threat to global health. This review provided strong support for central nervous system (CNS) infection with SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the neurological mechanism underlying the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the published data, only 1.28% COVID-19 patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. However, this does not mean the absence of CNS infection in most COVID-19 patients because postmortem studies revealed that some patients with CNS infection showed negative results in CSF tests for SARS-CoV-2. Among 20 neuropathological studies reported so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain of 58 cases in nine studies, and three studies have provided sufficient details on the CNS infection in COVID-19 patients. Almost all in vitro and in vivo experiments support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. In infected animals, SARS-CoV-2 was found within neurons in different brain areas with a wide spectrum of neuropathology, consistent with the reported clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 used the hematopoietic route to enter the CNS. But more evidence supports the trans-neuronal hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to invade the brain via the olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal pathways, especially at the early stage of infection. Severe COVID-19 patients with neurological deficits are at a higher risk of mortality, and only the infected animals showing neurological symptoms became dead, suggesting that neurological involvement may be one cause of death."
Prevention of COVID-19 infection in a pediatric oncology ward in Wuhan.,"Objective: To assess the screening and isolation measures for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from newly admitted patients into a pediatric oncology ward. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with established hematologic malignancies admitted for chemotherapy from January 23 to March 27, 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Every patient and their caregivers were well educated on personal protection and put it into effect at home and in hospital. Screening for COVID-19 of all the patients and caregivers before admission was performed. Both clinical features and screening results including chest computerized tomography (CT); nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or anal swabs; and quantitative antibodies (IgM and IgG) detecting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of these patients were described. Results: The results of nucleic acid and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing of all the 44 inpatients and their caregivers were negative. Abnormal chest CT images were observed in six symptomatic patients, while chest CT images of their caregivers did not show the changes related to viral pneumonia. These symptomatic patients all recovered after antibacterial combined with antifungal treatment, but without any antiviral agents. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection could be prevented in pediatric patients with malignancies if proper protective measures were implemented. For patients presenting suspicious symptoms, comprehensive examinations should be carried out."
Emergence of ancient convalescent plasma (CP) therapy: To manage COVID-19 pandemic.,"Since December 2019, the human populations of the 195 global countries continue experiencing grave health and life threats due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the novelty of the pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), at present there is lack of preventive as well as therapeutic options for treating and managing the infection. The use of ancient immunotherapeutic technique - the convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, may act as an immediate and available option to control the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides a concept and understanding on the CP therapy, its potential to control SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The CP therapy might act as an immediate saviour for society from the virus. Although the CP therapy has exert affirmative result against COVID-19 it has not been recommended for long time use in COVID-19 and this review gives support for its possible application."
Venous thromboembolism among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at Veterans Health Administration Hospitals.,"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at heightened risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), though there is no data examining when these events occur following a COVID-19 diagnosis. We therefore sought to characterize the incidence, timecourse of events, and outcomes of VTE during the COVID-19 pandemic in a national healthcare system using data from Veterans Affairs Administration."
A new parameter in COVID-19 pandemic: initial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio for diagnosis and mortality.,"Background: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a pandemic disease, infecting more than 26.5 million people. Since there is no specific and effective treatment; early diagnosis and optimal isolation of the patient are of vital importance. Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based (RT-PCR) analyses do not achieve sufficient sensitivity in the diagnosis of the disease. Methods: The data from 2217 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and hospitalized or discharged with home isolation were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, PCR results, initial computed tomography (CT), laboratory values, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio, initial treatments and last status were recorded. The diagnostic sensitivity of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio, which is the main purpose of the study, was analyzed statistically. Results: In order to test the effectiveness of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes, CT results were considered as gold standard. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.706 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.06) (Sensitivity: 76.4, specificity: 59.60). For the evaluation of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio in terms of survival, AUC was found to be 0.749 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.21) (Sensitivity: 70.59, specificity: 73.88). Conclusion: Studies based on radiological findings have demonstrated that CT involvement has higher sensitivity. LDH/Lymphocyte ratio was analyzed in terms of diagnosis and mortality with using specific CT involvement as gold standard method which was found to be a more sensitive due to PCR false negativity; 0.06 and 0.21 were obtained as cut off values for diagnosis and mortality."
SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays Dependent on Dual-Antigen Binding Demonstrate Diverging Kinetics Relative to Other Antibody Detection Methods.,"Longitudinal studies assessing durability of the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) humoral immune response have generated conflicting results. This has been proposed to be due to differences in patient populations, the lack of standardized methodologies, and the use of assays that measure distinct aspects of the humoral response. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were serially measured in sera from a cohort of 44 well-characterized convalescent plasma donors over 120 days post-COVID-19 symptom onset, utilizing eight assays, which varied according to antigen source, the detected antibody isotype, and the activity measured (i.e., binding, blocking, or neutralizing). While the majority of assays demonstrated a gradual decline in antibody titers over the course of 120 days, the two electrochemiluminescence immunoassay Roche assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 [qualitative, nucleocapsid based] and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [semiquantitative, spike based]), which utilize dual-antigen binding for antibody detection, demonstrated stable and/or increasing antibody titers over the study period. This study is among the first to assess longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among convalescent COVID-19 patients, primarily using commercially available serologic assays with Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization. We show that SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is dependent on the serologic method used, which has implications for future assay utilization and clinical value."
2020 in 20/20 hindsight.,"For biologic scientists, as for the society in general, the year 2020 was one that few will soon forget. However, in the realm of science, it is possible that it won't be remembered purely, or even mainly, for the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the many discoveries related to its causative agent. Even as non-SARS-related research was brought to a near standstill for much of the year, we may in time come to recognize that revolutionary work in other areas of biology was emerging unnoticed under the shadow of the virus."
Challenges and prospects of COVID-19 vaccine development based on the progress made in SARS and MERS vaccine development.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic has shaken the global health system and economy by their roots. This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past."
Young Adult Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccinations.,"Purpose: Young adults have the highest cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection in the country. Using March 2021 Household Pulse Survey data, an ongoing, cross-sectional nationally representative survey, we examined U.S. young adult intention to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Young adult (ages 18-25 years) Household Pulse Survey participants were queried on intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and related perspectives (N = 5,082). Results: Most unvaccinated respondents (76%) indicated an intention to become vaccinated. The most frequently cited reasons for potentially rejecting vaccination included desire to wait and see if the vaccine is safe (56%); concerns over side effects (53%); and believing others are in greater need of the vaccine (44%). Conclusions: With 24% of young adults hesitant to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, public health interventions should target reasons for hesitancy, address concerns about safety and side effects, and underscore the importance of vaccinations for this population."
Psychological and Behavioral Predictors of Vaccine Efficacy: Considerations for COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates are being evaluated, with the goal of conferring immunity on the highest percentage of people who receive the vaccine as possible. It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy."
Rapid and cost-effective process based on insect larvae for scale-up production of SARS-COV-2 spike protein for serological COVID-19 testing.,"Serology testing for COVID-19 is important in evaluating active immune response against SARS-CoV-2, studying the antibody kinetics, and monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new virus strains, in particular, the duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals and vaccine-mediated immunity. In this study, recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in Rachiplusia nu, an important agronomic plague. One gram of insect larvae produces an amount of S protein sufficient for 150 determinations in the ELISA method herein developed. We established a rapid production process for SARS-CoV-2 S protein that showed immunoreactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and was used as a single antigen for developing the ELISA method with high sensitivity (96.2%) and specificity (98.8%). Our findings provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for large-scale S protein production, and the scale-up is linear, thus avoiding the use of complex equipment like bioreactors."
Treatment of Patients with Mental Illness Amid A Global COVID-19 Pandemic.,"A newly discovered coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is not only physically challenging but also has many subtle and overt mental impacts. The concern of being infected, lack of antiviral agents, preventive strategies of social distancing, and home isolation have created unrest in the society. The way of reacting to emergencies varies from individual to individual, and that this variability lies in our unique personality traits. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the mental stability of all of us, and hence it is crucial to recognize the vulnerable population and support them to prevent or minimize the catastrophe like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional trauma, and suicides. In this context, the role of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and other mental healthcare providers is indispensable."
Fatal cerebral haemorrhage after COVID-19 vaccine.,"Background: New vaccines against COVID-19 are being rolled out globally. AstraZeneca's vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was not known to cause vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) at the time of this case. Case presentation: The patient was a previously healthy woman in her thirties with headaches that developed one week after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Three days later, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she presented to the emergency department with slurred speech, uncoordinated movements and reduced consciousness. Symptoms progressed to left-sided hemiparesis and her level of consciousness deteriorated. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed a large right-sided haemorrhage and incipient herniation. She was found to have severe thrombocytopenia 37 x 109/l, (ref 145 - 390 x 109/l). In spite of efforts to reduce intracranial pressure, the patient died the following day. Post mortem examination revealed antibodies to PF4, and fresh small thrombi were found in the transverse sinus, frontal lobe and pulmonary artery. Interpretation: Severe thrombocytopenia and antibodies to PF4 make a diagnosis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) likely."
Multiscale Feedback Loops in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Evolution.,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral genome is considered to be relatively stable and the mutations that have been observed and reported thus far are mainly focused on the coding region. This article provides evidence that macrolevel pandemic dynamics, such as social distancing, modulate the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This view complements the prevalent paradigm that microlevel observables control macrolevel parameters such as death rates and infection patterns. First, we observe differences in mutational signals for geospatially separated populations such as the prevalence of A23404G in CA versus NY and WA. We show that the feedback between macrolevel dynamics and the viral population can be captured employing a transfer entropy framework. Second, we observe complex interactions within mutational clades. Namely, when C14408T first appeared in the viral population, the frequency of A23404G spiked in the subsequent week. Third, we identify a noncoding mutation, G29540A, within the segment between the coding gene of the N protein and the ORF10 gene, which is largely confined to NY (>95%). These observations indicate that macrolevel sociobehavioral measures have an impact on the viral genomics and may be useful for the dashboard-like tracking of its evolution. Finally, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically robust organism, our findings suggest that we are dealing with a high degree of adaptability. Owing to its ample spread, mutations of unusual form are observed and a high complexity of mutational interaction is exhibited."
"Desperate Times, Desperate Measures: The Case for RRx-001 in the Treatment of COVID-19.","This article summarizes the likely attenuation properties of RRx-001 in COVID-19 based on its mechanism of action and the putative pathogenesis of the disease, which appears to activate inflammatory, oxidative, and immune cascades with the potential to culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm and death. An ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 appears to present with 3 major patterns of clinical symptomatology: (1) mild upper respiratory tract infection, (2) non-life-threatening pneumonia, and (3) severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that initially manifest as a mild prodrome lasting for 7-8 days before rapid clinical and radiological deterioration requiring ICU transfer. RRx-001 is a targeted nitric oxide donor. This small molecule, which has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1-2 clinical trials for cancer as well as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer called REPLATINUM (NCT03699956), is minimally toxic and demonstrates clear evidence of antitumor activity. During the course of these clinical trials it was noted that the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and pneumonia in actively smoking small cell lung cancer patients treated with RRx-001 is less than 1%. Due to extensive history of tobacco use, 40%-70% of patients with lung cancer have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the expected rate of pulmonary infection in this population is 50%-70%, which was not observed in RRx-001 clinical trials. Moreover, in preclinical studies of pulmonary hypertension, RRx-001 was found to be comparable with or more effective than the FDA approved agent, Bosentan. The potential pulmonary protective effects of RRx-001 in patients with recurrent lung infections coupled with preclinical models demonstrating RRx-001-mediated reversal of pulmonary hypertension suggests RRx-001 may have therapeutic activity in patients with acute respiratory symptoms due to COVID 19. Clinical trials have been initiated to confirm the hypothesis that RRx-001 may be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection."
BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is significantly less effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"Patients with hematologic malignancies have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 is especially important in these patients, but whether they develop an immune response following vaccination is unknown. We studied serologic responses to the BNT162b2 vaccine in this population. A lower proportion of patients were seropositive following vaccination (75%) than in a comparison group (99%; p < 0.001), and median (interquartile range [IQR]) antibody titers in patients were lower (90 [12.4-185.5] and 173 [133-232] AU/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and number of treatment lines correlated with lower seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers, while absolute lymphocyte count, globulin level, and time from last treatment to vaccination correlated with higher seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had the lowest seropositivity rate followed by indolent lymphoma. Patients recently treated with chemo-immunotherapy, anti-CD20 antibodies, BCL2, BTK or JAK2 inhibitors had significantly less seropositive responses and lower median (IQR) antibody titers (29%, 1.9 [1.9-12] AU/ml; 0%, 1.9 [1.9-1.9] AU/ml; 25%, 1.9 [1.9-25] AU/ml; 40%, 1.9 [1.9-92.8] AU/ml; and 42%, 10.9 [5.7-66.4] AU/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with hematologic malignancies is considerably impaired, and they could remain at risk for severe COVID-19 infection and death."
Understanding air and water borne transmission and survival of coronavirus: Insights and way forward for SARS-CoV-2.,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented disease burden, healthcare costs, and economic impacts worldwide. Despite several measures, SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely impactful due to its extraordinary infection potential mainly through coronavirus-borne saliva respiratory and droplet nuclei of an infected person and its considerable stability on surfaces. Although the disease has affected over 180 countries, its extent and control are significantly different across the globe, making it a strong case for exploration of its behavior and dependence across various environmental pathways and its interactions with the virus. This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation; a complete array of coronavirus survival and transmission from an infected individual through air- and water-borne channels and its subsequent intractions with environmental factors, surfaces, particulates and chemicals is not comprehensively explored. Particulate matter (PM) is omnipresent with variable concentrations, structures and composition, while most of the surfaces are also covered by PM of different characteristics. Learning from the earlier coronavirus studies, including SARS and MERS, an attempt has been made to understand the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the host body and discuss the probable air and water-borne transmission routes and its interactions with the outside environment. The present work 1) Helps appreciate the role of PM, its chemical constituents and surface characteristics and 2) Further identifies gaps in this field and suggests possible domains to work upon for better understanding of transmission and survival of this novel coronavirus."
The Molecular Interplay between Human Coronaviruses and Autophagy.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has instantaneously emerged as a worldwide pandemic. However, humans encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and they caused a broad range of symptoms, from mild to life-threatening, depending on the virus and immunocompetence of the host. Most human coronaviruses interact with the proteins and/or double-membrane vesicles of autophagy, the membrane trafficking pathway that degrades and recycles the intracellular protein aggregates, organelles, and pathogens, including viruses. However, coronaviruses often neutralize and hijack this pathway to complete their life cycle. In this review, we discuss the interactions of human coronaviruses and autophagy, including recent data from SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Some of these interactions (for example, viral block of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion), while being conserved across multiple coronaviruses, are accomplished via different molecular mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular interplay between human coronaviruses and autophagy for developing efficient therapies against coronaviral diseases."

"The Era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Review on Dynamics, Clinical Symptoms and Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) displays a broad spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from lack of symptoms to severe multiorgan system complications and death. Various laboratory assays have been employed in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including: nucleic acid-based tests; antigen tests; and serum testing for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. The disease can also be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical features and radiological findings. Until now, remdesivir is the only medication approved for the treatment of COVID-19 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, it is anticipated that several anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies will gain soon approval. Other methods of treatment include supportive care directed toward treating the symptoms. Nevertheless, many studies have recently emerged, showing controversial preliminary results with the off-label medication hydroxychloroquine. Given that all results are still preliminary, including those seen by remdesivir, additional evidence and research are required to identify effective medications that are broadly effective and well tolerated. Importantly, two RNA-based vaccines have recently gained approval from Pfizer and Moderna, with many others still in clinical trials. This article reviews various aspects of COVID-19, including its epidemiology; its evolution and mutational spectrum; and its clinical dynamics, symptoms and complications, diagnosis, and treatment."
"Durable Antibody Responses in Staff at Two Long-Term Care Facilities, during and Post SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks.","SARS-CoV-2 has had a disproportionate impact on nonhospital health care settings, such as long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). The communal nature of these facilities, paired with the high-risk profile of residents, has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths and a high case fatality rate. To detect presymptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs, which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Together, our results suggest that a high seroprevalence rate among staff can contribute to immunity within a workplace and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility. IMPORTANCE Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 due to their communal nature and high-risk profile of residents. LTCF staff have the ability to introduce SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, where it can spread, causing outbreaks. We tested staff weekly at two LTCFs and collected blood throughout the study to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One site had a large outbreak and infected individuals rapidly generated antibodies after infection. At the other site, almost half the staff already had antibodies, suggesting prior infection. The majority of these antibodies bind to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are potently neutralizing and stable for many months. The non-outbreak site had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Our results reveal that high seroprevalence among staff can contribute to immunity and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility."
Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,This cohort study assesses the risk of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated risk factors among exposed household members.
From influenza to COVID-19: Lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines at the frontiers of infectious diseases.,"Vaccination represents the best line of defense against infectious diseases and is crucial in curtailing pandemic spread of emerging pathogens to which a population has limited immunity. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been proposed as the new frontier in vaccination, owing to their facile and rapid development while providing a safer alternative to traditional vaccine technologies such as live or attenuated viruses. Recent breakthroughs in mRNA vaccination have been through formulation with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which provide both protection and enhanced delivery of mRNA vaccines in vivo. In this review, current paradigms and state-of-the-art in mRNA-LNP vaccine development are explored through first highlighting advantages posed by mRNA vaccines, establishing LNPs as a biocompatible delivery system, and finally exploring the use of mRNA-LNP vaccines in vivo against infectious disease towards translation to the clinic. Furthermore, we highlight the progress of mRNA-LNP vaccine candidates against COVID-19 currently in clinical trials, with the current status and approval timelines, before discussing their future outlook and challenges that need to be overcome towards establishing mRNA-LNPs as next-generation vaccines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the recent success of mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer against COVID-19, mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have never received more attention. This manuscript timely reviews the most advanced mRNA-LNP vaccines that have just been approved for emergency use and are in clinical trials, with a focus on the remarkable development of several COVID-19 vaccines, faster than any other vaccine in history. We aim to give a comprehensive introduction of mRNA and LNP technology to the field of biomaterials science and increase accessibility to readers with a new interest in mRNA-LNP vaccines. We also highlight current limitations and future outlook of the mRNA vaccine technology that need further efforts of biomaterials scientists to address."
On the Challenges for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Based on a Review of Current Methodologies.,"Diagnosis of COVID-19 has been challenging owing to the need for mass testing and for combining distinct types of detection to cover the different stages of the infection. In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry. Of special relevance are the methodologies which can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices and the use of artificial intelligence that do not require products from a well-developed biotech industry."
Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection : A Randomized Trial.,"Background: Effective prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently limited to nonpharmaceutical strategies. Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. Objective: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). Setting: National U.S. multicenter study. Participants: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intervention: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. Measurements: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. Results: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). Limitation: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. Conclusion: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Characterization of 100 sequential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations.,"Background: Transfusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent plasma is a promising treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with success of the intervention based on neutralizing antibody content. Measurement by serologic correlates without biocontainment needs as well as an understanding of donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate effective collection. Study design and methods: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Donor demographics such as COVID-19 severity, age, and sex were correlated with antibody titers. Results: A mean neutralization titer 50% of 230 (range, <8-1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (P < .0001) yet quantitatively limited (R2 = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>500) from analysis improved correlation (R2 = 0.5386). A tendency of higher-titer plasma units from donors with increased disease severity, of advanced age, and of male sex was seen, yet the functional relevance of this difference is questionable. Conclusion: The ELISA-based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower-titer units from the clinical supply for COVID-19 treatment. Disease severity may be associated with the development of higher titers of neutralizing antibodies, although larger case numbers will be needed for additional confirmation."
Serological follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic subjects.,"SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are non-specific and can range from asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up. These data should be taken into account for the interpretation of the serological evidences on SARS-CoV-2 that are emerging nowadays."
Dentistry and Covid-19 pandemic: operative indications post-lockdown.,"A new Coronavirus, the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread in late December 2019 in the territory of Wuhan in China. CoV-2019 can be transmitted directly from person to person by respiratory drops, direct contact and contaminated material. Furthermore, 2019-nCov penetrates cells similarly to the SARS coronavirus, i.e., through the ACE2 receptor. This may promote human-to-human transmission. Patients and dental professionals are exposed daily to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria, which infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. Dental procedures carry the risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to their specificity. Direct transmission regards the distance between operator and patient, exposure to saliva, blood and other body fluids, the use of sharp instruments and ""droplet-generating"" rotating instruments, contact with the conjunctival mucosa, and finally the contact with droplets produced by coughing and nasal secretion of an infected individual without mask at short distance, increasing the biological risk for the operator. In light of the pandemic linked to COVID-19, although there is no clear scientific evidence in the literature, it is necessary to identify protections with regard to clothing, operating protocols, disinfection of environments and management of waiting rooms and front offices. This paper is a basis for operative indications for dentists and other health care professionals in phase 2 post lockdown for both private and public structures."
Well-Newborn Unit Director Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A BORN Study.,"Background: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread across the country, well-newborn unit medical directors developed newborn care plans as guidelines and evidence evolved. We chose to examine approaches to newborn care during these early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An electronic survey was administered to well-newborn unit directors in a national network of US well-newborn units in May 2020. Respondents were asked about their approaches to testing, infection prevention, routine newborn care, discharge planning, breastfeeding, rounding, and teaching. Results: Of 107 sites, 65 (61%) respondents completed the survey. Respondents estimated a 1% positivity rate of 1198 newborns tested for COVID-19. Most sites (86%) performed universal maternal COVID-19 testing, and most (82%) tested newborns of COVID-19-positive mothers at 24 hours of life (75%). Infection prevention and visitation policies varied. Of respondents, in COVID-19-positive mothers, 28% permitted no visitors, 54% recommended rooming-in with the newborn, 55% encouraged breastfeeding at the breast, 38% deferred routine circumcisions of the newborn, 74% initiated immediate bathing of the newborn, 68% continued standard newborn screening, and 55% modified newborn follow-up plans. Medical directors reported adjustments to rounding and teaching workflow. Content analysis of free-text responses revealed themes related to challenges with changing recommendations, discomfort with mother-infant separation recommendations, innovations, and stress management. Conclusions: Well-newborn units quickly adopted universal maternal testing and testing of exposed newborns. Despite guidelines, we identified variation in the care of newborns of COVID-19-positive mothers. Further investigation of these differences and newborn outcomes is warranted to develop best practices."
Adherence to Immunization: Rebuttal of Vaccine Hesitancy.,"Immunizations have been saving the lives of millions of people since they were first used by Edward Jenner in 1796, and new vaccines are being developed all the time. Hopefully, a new vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be developed in the near future, and perhaps even one for human immunodeficiency virus. Although the effectiveness of vaccinations has been proven over the years and adverse effects to currently available vaccinations are extremely rare, many people continue to defer immunizations for themselves and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this phenomenon, known as ""vaccine hesitancy,"" is a major public health problem globally. This review summarizes the unproven adverse effects of various vaccines and stresses the importance of enforcing vaccination policies to minimize vaccine hesitancy. Every effort should be made to improve existing vaccines and to produce new ones, according to carefully designed scientific preclinical and clinical trials. This is particularly important in today's era, in light of the global transparency regarding vaccination development, and the potential for future pandemics such as COVID-19."
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the race to trace: contact tracing scale-up in San Francisco-early lessons learned.,"In order to effectively control spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), it is essential that jurisdictions have the capacity to rapidly trace close contacts of each and every case. Best practice guidance on how to implement such programs is urgently needed. We describe the early experience in the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), where the City's Department of Health expanded contact tracing capability in anticipation of changes in San Francisco's 'shelter in place' order between April and June 2020. Important prerequisites to successful scale-up included a rapid expansion of the COVID-19 response workforce, expansion of testing capability, and other containment resources. San Francisco's scale-up offers a model for how other jurisdictions can rapidly mobilize a workforce. We underscore the importance of an efficient digital case management system, effective training, and expansion of supportive service programs for those in quarantine or isolation, and metrics to ensure continuous performance improvement."
Progress in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and the role of surgeons in the front line of the pandemic.,"The current struggle to control and contain COVID-19 is critical and surgeons are on the front line in the fight against this virus. Surgeons, and other medical workers in the field of surgery, have a solid foundation and experience in medical treatment and intensive care, and an understanding of the support of respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and other systemic organs. Furthermore, the operative standards of aseptic technique in their daily work enable surgeons to adapt to the working environment in infected areas. As surgeons in the anti-pandemic front line in China, we describe our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in this country and how the work of surgeons is unfolding during the pandemic."
Diagnostic value and key features of computed tomography in Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"On 31 December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and caused the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, computed tomography (CT) findings have been recommended as major evidence for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. This review focuses on the imaging characteristics and changes throughout the disease course in patients with COVID-19 in order to provide some help for clinicians. Typical CT findings included bilateral ground-glass opacity, pulmonary consolidation, and prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral parts of the lungs. This review also provides a comparison between COVID-19 and other diseases that have similar CT findings. Since most patients with COVID-19 infection share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice."
Influenza vaccine community outreach: Leveraging an interprofessional healthcare student workforce to immunize marginalized populations.,"Vulnerable populations such as the uninsured, unemployed, and unhoused face significant morbidity and mortality from influenza but are less likely to receive the annual vaccine and have limited access to medical care. We describe an interprofessional, student-run vaccine outreach program (VOP) in Davidson County, Tennessee that lowers barriers to vaccination through free vaccination events in nontraditional community locations. We provide this framework as a model to expand novel, seasonal, or outbreak-oriented vaccine outreach to resource-poor populations. Demographic data were collected from the patients who received an influenza vaccine between 2015 and 2019 through an optional survey to determine whether these events were reaching unhoused, uninsured, and/or unemployed individuals. Of 1,803 patients, 1,733 (96.1%) completed at least one field of the demographic form. Overall, 481 (27.8%) were individuals without homes or living in temporary housing and 673 (38.8%) were unemployed. Most patients, 1,109 (64.0%), did not have health insurance at any point during the prior two years. With the addition of a nurse practitioner student to VOP leadership, the 2018-2019 VOP reached the most unhoused or temporarily-housed (228, 32.3%), unemployed (313, 18.5%), and disabled (60, 8.5%) patients. The VOP can be adapted to meet community needs, funding, and volunteer interest. The VOP model may be applicable to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, especially since the economic impact of COVID-19 has increased unemployment rates and housing instability. Healthcare students serve as an eager, underutilized resource who can be leveraged to disseminate vaccines to individuals with limited access to care."
"Effectiveness of the Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers, Treviso province, Veneto region, Italy, 27 December 2020 to 24 March 2021.","Data on effectiveness of the BioNTech-/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings are limited. In a study of 6,423 healthcare workers in Treviso Province, Italy, we estimated that, within the time intervals of 14-21 days from the first and at least 7 days from the second dose, vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 84% (95% confidence interval (CI): 40-96) and 95% (95% CI: 62-99), respectively. These results could support the ongoing vaccination campaigns by providing evidence for targeted communication."
An Overview of the Temporal Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Specimens.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 quickly spread in China and has, since March 2020 become a pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The causative agent was promptly isolated and named SARS-CoV-2. Scientific efforts are related to identifying the best clinical management of these patients, but also in understanding their infectivity in order to limit the spread of the virus. Aimed at identifying viral RNA in the various compartments of the organism of sick subjects, diagnostic tests are carried out. However, the accuracy of such tests varies depending on the type of specimen used and the time of illness at which they are performed. This review of the literature aims to summarize the preliminary findings reported in studies on Covid-19 testing. The results highlight how the pharyngeal swab is highly sensitive in the first phase of the disease, while in the advanced stages, other specimens should be considered, such as sputum, or even stool to detect SARS-CoV-2. It highlights that most patients already reach the peak of the viral load in the upper airways within the first days of displaying symptoms, which thereafter tend to decrease. This suggests that many patients may already be infectious before symptoms start to appear."
Screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection during labor and delivery using polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin testing.,"Aims: To assess severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during labor and delivery with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and using immunoglobulin G and M testing to correlate with maternal and perinatal outcomes. Main methods: Pregnant women admitted for labor and delivery at two Spanish hospitals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test and by detection of serum immunoglobulins G and M. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared in women with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with those with negative tests. Key findings: Between March 31st and September 30th, 2020, 1211 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 5.4% (n = 65), corresponding to (i) 22 ongoing infections at admission, including two with mild clinical symptoms and 20 asymptomatic women; (ii) 43 cases of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure; (iii) and 1146 women who were negative for both SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serological test. None of the screened mothers required hospital admission for coronavirus disease before or after delivery, nor were any of the newborns admitted to the intensive care unit. All newborns from mothers with positive PCR on admission were PCR negative. There were no significant differences in maternal or perinatal outcomes among the three studied groups. Significance: Ongoing or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with asymptomatic or mild clinical symptoms detected during screening in pregnant women at labor and delivery do not have a higher rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes."
Comprehensive evaluation of eight commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays.,"Sensitivity and specificity of serological assays are key parameters for the accurate estimation of SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence. The aim of this study was to compare 8 readily available IgG antibody tests using a panel of well-defined serum samples of prepandemic and pandemic origin. A cross-reaction panel included samples of patients with recent infection with either of the endemic Coronaviruses 229E, NL63, HKU1, or OC43. Additionally, samples with high antibody levels against influenza virus, adenovirus, and during acute EBV infection were included. Previous infection with endemic coronaviruses caused a significant amount of cross-reactivity in two of the assays. In contrast, the confidence intervals for the assays of Abbott, DiaSorin, Euroimmun and Roche encompassed the value of 98% for samples with a previous endemic HCoV infection. For all assays, sensitivities were between 91.3% and 98.8%. Assay performance was independent of the usage of either nucleocapsid or spike proteins."
COVID-19 presenting with nystagmus.,"This case reports a 20-year-old female patient who was in northern Italy when the state of emergency was declared on the 31st of January 2020, developing 15days after return to Spain upper respiratory symptoms characterized by fever, headache and anosmia that was treated as sinusitis. Three weeks later presented with dizziness and an intermittent horizontal nystagmus with rotatory component. Otorhinolaryngology and neurological examination including MRI were normal. COVID-19 IgG antibodies where positive. In the context of the ongoing pandemic, and associating the symptoms with positive IgG antibodies, we can consider the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as a probable cause of the acquired nystagmus."
Analysis of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"A newly-emergent beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, rapidly has become a pandemic since 2020. It is a serious respiratory disease and caused more than 100 million of deaths in the world. WHO named it COVIA-19 and there is no effective targeted drug for it. The main treatment strategies include chemical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and biologics. Due to SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike proteins (S proteins) on its envelope to infect human cells, monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the S protein have become one of the hot research areas in the current research and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we reviewed the antibodies that have been reported to have neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to their different binding epitope regions in RBD or NTD, they are classified, and the mechanism of the representative antibodies in each category is discussed in depth, which provides potential foundation for future antibody and vaccine therapy and the development of antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 mutants."
A Japanese case of COVID-19: An autopsy report.,"A 93-year-old woman was admitted with a 10-day history of cough and prostration. Thoracic computed tomography revealed extensive ground-glass opacities in both the lungs. The polymerase chain reaction test of sputum for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. She was treated with antiviral agents and steroid pulse therapy. However, her oxygen saturation gradually declined, and she died 10 days after hospitalization. The most important autopsy finding was fuzzily segmented diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) that expanded from the subpleural to the medial area. No remarkable changes were observed in organs other than the lungs. Therefore, pneumocytes were suggested as the primary target for SARS-CoV-2, which might explain why coronavirus infectious disease-19 is a serious condition. Thus, early treatment is essential to prevent viral replication from reaching a level that triggers DAD."
"A comparative study of human betacoronavirus spike proteins: structure, function and therapeutics.","Coronaviruses are the paradigm of emerging 21st century zoonotic viruses, triggering numerous outbreaks and a severe global health crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 51 million people across the globe as of 12 November 2020. The crown-like spikes on the surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The spike (S) protein adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the virus into the host. This multifunctional protein mediates the entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. This review article focuses on the structural and functional comparison of S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we review the current state of knowledge about receptor recognition, the membrane fusion mechanism, structural epitopes, and glycosylation sites of the S proteins of these viruses. We further discuss various vaccines and other therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and small molecules based on the S protein of these three viruses."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction in different clinical specimens: A critical review.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally, since the outbreak, more than seven million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The rapid spread and increase in the number of new cases is due to person-to-person transmission. To further control its transmission, early laboratory diagnosis of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial. Presently, the COVID-19 diagnosis of infected individuals is dependent on computed tomography scanning and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter is considered more sensitive and efficient for early diagnosis. In this review, general comparisons are made (cases, fatality rate, incubation period, clinical features, and reservoirs) and diagnostic laboratory procedures (specimens, extraction methods, and positive rates by real-time PCR) are compared between SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-2. In total, 8982 SARS-2 suspected patients specimen data were retrieved, in which 40.9% (n = 3678) were detected as positive by real-time PCR. The specimen-wise high detection rate was observed from bronchoalveolar lavage, followed by saliva, nasal swabs, and sputum. As the COVID-19 cases are persistently increasing, the selection of appropriate specimens and laboratory assay would help in rapid and timely diagnosis."
Sense of purpose in life predicts greater willingness for COVID-19 vaccination.,"Rationale: Despite the clear public health significance of herd immunity to COVID-19, a host of individual differences influence willingness to get vaccinated. One factor likely to motivate individuals is the extent they have a sense of purpose in life, based on the health correlates of purpose and purposeful individuals' desire to return to their pre-pandemic environments. Objective: The current study examined sense of purpose as a predictor of COVID-19 vaccination willingness in the United States immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. Methods: A nationwide sample of U. S. adults (N = 2009) completed a poll including information on their sense of purpose in life, demographic factors, and depressive symptoms, immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. In addition, they reported on how willing they would be to get the vaccine, assuming that the costs would be covered, as well as their motivations to get the vaccine. Results: Multiple regression analyses found that sense of purpose predicted greater willingness to get vaccinated, even when accounting for demographic factors, political affiliation, and psychological wellbeing. Adults higher on sense of purpose reported greater importance of getting the vaccine for personal health, the health of others, and to return to regular activities. Exploratory analyses also suggest that purpose may provide a stronger impetus to vaccinate among those in age groups associated with lower risk for severe COVID-19 complications. Conclusions: Although cross-sectional in nature, the current findings suggest sense of purpose in life may be an important factor in encouraging vaccination. Implications are discussed regarding how purposeful messaging may yield greater vaccination rates among individuals who otherwise may be less motivated due to health concerns."
Rationale Use of Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for early diagnosis and stratification of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease is caused by a virus that is the cause of a potentially fatal disease worldwide. Coronavirus is a pathogen that primarily affects the human respiratory system. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been named WHO since February 11, 2020. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019. In January 2020, COVID-19 infection was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China. We analyze the role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in viral infection with special emphasize on novel corona virus disease-COVID-19. NLR may be used for early detection and may reflect progression to the more severe illness leading to SARS-CoV-2. In the mini review we investigate the use of NLR as a surrogate marker for diagnosis and stratification of COVID-19.Clinical symptoms such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart damage have led to death. In some cases, multiple inflammations have been observed. Treatment with interferon inhalation showed no clinical effect and the condition worsened instead (Tab. 5, Fig. 1, Ref. 18). Keywords: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, corona virus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19."
Social media and vaccine hesitancy.,"Background: Understanding the threat posed by anti-vaccination efforts on social media is critically important with the forth coming need for world wide COVID-19 vaccination programs. We globally evaluate the effect of social media and online foreign disinformation campaigns on vaccination rates and attitudes towards vaccine safety. Methods: Weuse a large-n cross-country regression framework to evaluate the effect ofsocial media on vaccine hesitancy globally. To do so, we operationalize social media usage in two dimensions: the use of it by the public to organize action(using Digital Society Project indicators), and the level of negative lyoriented discourse about vaccines on social media (using a data set of all geocoded tweets in the world from 2018-2019). In addition, we measure the level of foreign-sourced coordinated disinformation operations on social media ineach country (using Digital Society Project indicators). The outcome of vaccine hesitancy is measured in two ways. First, we use polls of what proportion ofthe public per country feels vaccines are unsafe (using Wellcome Global Monitor indicators for 137 countries). Second, we use annual data of actual vaccination rates from the WHO for 166 countries. Results: We found the use of social media to organise offline action to be highly predictive of the belief that vaccinations are unsafe, with such beliefs mounting as more organisation occurs on social media. In addition, the prevalence of foreign disinformation is highly statistically and substantively significant in predicting a drop in mean vaccination coverage over time. A 1-point shift upwards in the 5-point disinformation scale is associated with a 2-percentage point drop in mean vaccination coverage year over year. We also found support for the connection of foreign disinformation with negative social media activity about vaccination. The substantive effect of foreign disinformation is to increase the number of negative vaccine tweets by 15% for the median country. Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between organisation on social media and public doubts of vaccine safety. In addition, there is a substantial relationship between foreign disinformation campaigns and declining vaccination coverage."
Therapeutic and Vaccine Options for COVID-19: Status after Six Months of the Disease Outbreak.,"An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by an infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus belongs to the group of enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent plasma."
Diagnosing COVID-19: The Disease and Tools for Detection.,"COVID-19 has spread globally since its discovery in Hubei province, China in December 2019. A combination of computed tomography imaging, whole genome sequencing, and electron microscopy were initially used to screen and identify SARS-CoV-2, the viral etiology of COVID-19. The aim of this review article is to inform the audience of diagnostic and surveillance technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and their performance characteristics. We describe point-of-care diagnostics that are on the horizon and encourage academics to advance their technologies beyond conception. Developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak would be useful in preventing future epidemics."
Factors Associated with Intention to Receive Vaccination against COVID-19 in Puerto Rico: An Online Survey of Adults.,"We conducted an online survey among adults in Puerto Rico to identify factors associated with the intention to receive vaccination against COVID-19. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed independently for association with intent to receive vaccination. Significant associations were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 1016 responses were available for analysis. In the bivariate analysis, younger age, higher education, pre-COVID-19 employment, male sex, gay/bisexual identity, and single marital status were associated with increased intent to receive the vaccination. In the multivariate logistic regression, younger, male respondents, and those with higher educational attainment reported higher intent to receive the vaccination. Lower-income and living outside the San Juan metro region were associated with lower intent to receive the vaccination. National and international health organizations were identified as the most reliable sources of information, followed by healthcare professionals. These findings highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic characteristics and using trusted sources of information when designing COVID-19 vaccination public messaging."
Quantifying Covid19-vaccine location strategies for Germany.,"Background: Vaccines are an important tool to limit the health and economic damage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Several vaccine candidates already provided promising effectiveness data, but it is crucial for an effective vaccination campaign that people are willing and able to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Taking Germany as an example, we provide insights of using a mathematical approach for the planning and location of vaccination sites to optimally administer vaccines against Covid-19. Methods: We used mathematical programming for computing an optimal selection of vaccination sites out of a given set (i.e., university hospitals, health department related locations and general practices). Different patient-to-facility assignments and doctor-to-facility assignments and different constraints on the number of vaccinees per site or maximum travel time are used. Results: In order to minimize the barriers for people to get vaccinated, i.e., limit the one-way travel journey (airline distance) by around 35 km for 75% of the population (with a maximum of 70 km), around 80 well-positioned facilities can be enough. If only the 38 university hospitals are being used, the 75% distance increases to around 50 km (with a maximum of 145 km). Using all 400 health departments or all 56 000 general practices can decrease the journey length significantly, but comes at the price of more required staff and possibly wastage of only partially used vaccine containers. Conclusions: In the case of free assignments, the number of required physicians can in most scenarios be limited to 2 000, which is also the minimum with our assumptions. However, when travel distances for the patients are to be minimized, capacities of the facilities must be respected, or administrative assignments are prespecified, an increased number of physicians is unavoidable."
A novel STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy and a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adjuvant.,"A novel STING agonist, CDGSF, ipsilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine, was synthesized. The phosphorothioate in CDGSF might be a site for covalent conjugation. Injection of CDGSF generated an immunogenic (""hot"") tumor microenvironment to suppress melanoma, more efficiently than dithio CDG. In particular, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using CDGSF as an adjuvant elicited an exceptionally high antibody titer and a robust T cell response, overcoming the drawbacks of aluminum hydroxide. These results highlighted the therapeutic potential of CDGSF for cancer immunotherapy and the adjuvant potential of the STING agonist in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for the first time."
"COVID-19: a review on SARS-CoV-2 origin, epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations and complications with special emphasis on adverse outcome in Bhopal Gas Tragedy survivor.","After the global outbreak of coronaviruses caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an outbreak due to these viruses occurred in December, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and led to a worldwide spread. Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious global health emergency and spread from a person to another who has the virus. But the scope of an intermediate host is not known. Population at higher risk includes individuals in higher age group (>60 years) or with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and weaker immune system. Many unknown and underestimate risk factors could be responsible for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should be appropriately identified, addressed and necessary actions should be taken to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Bhopal gas tragedy was one of the world's worst industrial chemical leak disaster. The survivors of this incident still suffer from the various complications such as increased rate of cancers, chronic illness like tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, birth defects, nerve injury, growth retardations, gynecological illness and many more. The survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 related adverse outcome. One of the possible explanations can be long term effect of methyl isocyanate (MIC). MIC exposure can lead to possible toxic effect on genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors. In this review, we aim to establish the scientific basis for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients who are also victims of Bhopal gas tragedy."
Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Case Volume and Education in the Age of Pandemics: Impact Analysis and Potential Future Directions.,"Rationale and objectives: To assess the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology education, and to propose measures to preserve and augment trainee education during future crises. Materials and methods: Diagnostic Radiology (DR) studies and Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures at a single tertiary-care teaching institution between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. DR was divided by section: body, cardiothoracic, musculoskeletal (MSK), neuroradiology, nuclear medicine, pediatrics, and women's imaging. IR was divided by procedural types: arterial, venous, lymphatic, core, neuro, pediatrics, dialysis, cancer embolization or ablation, noncancer embolization, portal hypertension, and miscellaneous. Impact on didactic education was also assessed. ANOVA, t test, and multiple comparison correction were used for analysis. Results: DR and IR caseloads decreased significantly in April 2020 compared to April of the prior 5 years (both p < 0.0001). Case volumes were reduced in body (49.2%, p < 0.01), MSK (54.2%, p < 0.05), neuro (39.3%, p < 0.05), and women's imaging (75.5%, p < 0.05) in DR, and in arterial (62.6%, p < 0.01), neuro IR (57.6%, p < 0.01) and core IR (42.6%, p < 0.05) in IR. IR trainee average caseload in April 2020 decreased 51.9% compared to April of the prior 5 years (p < 0.01). Utilization of online learning increased in April. Trainees saw significant increases in overall DR didactics (31.3%, p = 0.02) and no reduction in IR didactics, all online. Twelve major national and international DR and IR meetings were canceled or postponed between March and July. Conclusion: Decreases in caseload and widespread cancellation of conferences have had significant impact on DR/IR training during COVID-19 restrictions. Remote learning technologies with annotated case recording, boards-style case reviews, procedural simulation and narrated live cases as well as online lectures and virtual journal clubs increased during this time. Whether remote learning can mitigate lost opportunities from in-person interactions remains uncertain. Optimizing these strategies will be important for potential future restricted learning paradigms and can also be extrapolated to augment trainee education during unrestricted times."
"Early Laboratory Preparedness of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and Response to Unknown Pneumonia Outbreak from Wuhan, China, in January 2020.","We report the response process of the Laboratory Analysis Task Force (LATF) for Unknown Disease Outbreaks (UDOs) at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) during January 2020 to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which developed as a UDO in Korea. The advanced preparedness offered by the laboratory diagnostic algorithm for UDOs related to respiratory syndromes was critical for the rapid identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and enabled us to establish and expand the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 on a national scale in a timely manner."
Development and evaluation of a Novel RT-PCR system for reliable and rapid SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations.,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused great global concerns. In contrast to SARS, some SARS-CoV-2-infected people can be asymptomatic or have only mild nonspecific symptoms. Furthermore, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. With the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in plasma or serum, blood safety is worthy of consideration. Study design and methods: We developed a nucleic acid test (NAT) screening system for SARS-CoV-2 targeting nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF 1ab) gene that could screen 5076 samples every 24 hours. The 2019 novel coronavirus RNA standard was used to evaluate linearity of standard curves. Diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated using artificial SARS-CoV-2. Specificity was evaluated with 61 other respiratory pathogens. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing two sputum and nine oropharyngeal swab specimens. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood donor specimens collected during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Chengdu. Results: Limits of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for N and ORF 1ab gene were 12.5 and 27.58 copies/mL, respectively. Intra-assay and interassay for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay based on cycle threshold were acceptably low. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory virus and bacterial isolates. The overall agreement value between the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and clinical diagnostic results was 100%. A total of 16 287 blood specimens collected from blood donors during SARS-CoV-2 surveillance were tested negative. Conclusions: A high-throughput NAT screening system was developed for SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2."
Achieving global equity for COVID-19 vaccines: Stronger international partnerships and greater advocacy and solidarity are needed.,Peter Figueroa and co-authors advocate for equity in the worldwide provision of COVID-19 vaccines.
Changes in lung ultrasound of symptomatic healthcare professionals with COVID-19 pneumonia and their association with clinical findings.,"Purpose: To evaluate ultrasound signs of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia in symptomatic healthcare professionals and to correlate those changes with clinical findings. Methods: All patients underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), lung ultrasound (LUS) and clinical evaluation on the same day. In each of the 12 areas evaluated in the LUS, the LUS signs were scored to generate the aeration score. Results: A total of 409 participants had positive PCR, with a median age of 41 (35-51) years. All participants had clinical symptoms, with cough in 84.1%, fever in 69.7%, and dyspnea in 36.2% of cases. In the LUS, 72.6% of participants had B-lines >2, 36.2% had coalescent B-lines, and 8.06% had subpleural consolidations. The median aeration score was 3 (2-7). The aeration score differed significantly regarding the presence of cough (P = .002), fever (P = .001), and dyspnea (P < .0001). The finding of subpleural consolidations in the LUS showed significant differences between participants with or without dyspnea (P < .0001). Conclusions: In healthcare professionals with COVID-19, LUS plays a key role in the characterization of lung involvement. Although B-lines are the most common ultrasound sign, subpleural consolidations are those that most impact the respiratory condition."
"[About possible medications to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19: is there any hope?].","To date, there is no treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several studies are being carried out in several countries and some have yielded promising results; however, still no effective treatment has been identified to combat COVID-19, one of the most serious threats humanity has suffered in the last 100 years."
Convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment of patients with COVID-19: Assessment of methods available for antibody detection and their correlation with neutralising antibody levels.,"Introduction: The lack of approved specific therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to the rapid implementation of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) trials in many countries, including the United Kingdom. Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody (nAb) in convalescent donations. Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of a large-scale collection. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 nAbs by microneutralisation and pseudo-type assays and for antibodies by four different ELISAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high nAb levels. Results: All samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%). The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation coefficient 0.88; p < 0.001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13/22). Discussion: Robust associations between nAb titres and reactivity in several ELISA-based antibody tests demonstrate their possible utility for scaled-up production of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs."
Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 pseudovirus by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera.,"Recently, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage called B.1.1.7 (variant of concern: VOC 202012/01), which is reported to spread more efficiently and faster than other strains, emerged in the United Kingdom. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations, with 10 amino acid changes in the spike (S) protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the messenger RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 lineage pseudovirus. These data indicate that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape BNT162b2-mediated protection."
SARS-CoV-2 and aerosols-Arguing over the evidence.,"This Commentary discusses various aspects around the controversial issue of SARSCoV-2 and aerosol transmission, highlighting certain counter arguments and explaining why they are invalid."
The role of kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems in COVID-19 infection.,"In November 2019 the first cases of a novel acute respiratory syndrome has been reported in Wuhan province, China. Soon after, in January 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic state due to the dissemination of a virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Being an unknown disease, it is essential to assess not only its main characteristic features and overall clinical symptomatology but also its patient infection mode and propagation to design appropriate clinical interventions and treatments. In this review the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how the virus enters the cells and activates the immune system are described. The role of three systems involved in the SARS- CoV-2 infection (renin-angiotensin, kinin and coagulation systems) is discussed with the objectives to identify and try to explain several of the events observed during the evolution of the disease and to suggest possible targets for therapeutic interventions."
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that attenuate monoclonal and serum antibody neutralization.,"Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of COVID-19 vaccines and have received emergency use authorization as therapeutics. However, viral escape mutants could compromise efficacy. To define immune-selected mutations in the S protein, we exposed a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, in which the VSV glycoprotein is replaced with the S protein, to 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and generated 50 different escape mutants. Each mAb had a unique resistance profile, although many shared residues within an epitope of the RBD. Some variants (e.g., S477N) were resistant to neutralization by multiple mAbs, whereas others (e.g., E484K) escaped neutralization by convalescent sera. Additionally, sequential selection identified mutants that escape neutralization by antibody cocktails. Comparing these antibody-mediated mutations with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-2 revealed substitutions that may attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans and thus warrant further investigation."
Rural community pharmacies' preparedness for and responses to COVID-19.,"Background: Few studies have documented rural community pharmacy disaster preparedness. Objectives: To: (1) describe rural community pharmacies' preparedness for and responses to COVID-19 and (2) examine whether responses vary by level of pharmacy rurality. Methods: A convenience sample of rural community pharmacists completed an online survey (62% response rate) that assessed: (a) demographic characteristics; (b) COVID-19 information source use; (c) interest in COVID-19 testing; (d) infection control procedures; (e) disaster preparedness training, and (f) medication supply impacts. Descriptive statistics were calculated and differences by pharmacy rurality were explored. Results: Pharmacists used the CDC (87%), state health departments (77%), and state pharmacy associations (71%) for COVID-19 information, with half receiving conflicting information. Most pharmacists (78%) were interested in offering COVID-19 testing but needed personal protective equipment and training to do so. Only 10% had received disaster preparedness training in the past five years. Although 73% had disaster preparedness plans, 27% were deemed inadequate for the pandemic. Nearly 70% experienced negative impacts in medication supply. There were few differences by rurality level. Conclusion: Rural pharmacies may be better positioned to respond to pandemics if they had disaster preparedness training, updated disaster preparedness plans, and received regular policy guidance from professional bodies."
Antibody response using six different serological assays in a completely PCR-tested community after a coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak-the CoNAN study.,"Objectives: Due to a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses, many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed to determine and characterize the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG-detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: (a) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic versus asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 courses, and (b) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence. Methods: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany, which was quarantined from 22 March to 5 April after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the village's population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak comprised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from 13 May to 22 May 2020, 6 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody-positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: median 2.9 versus 7.2 IgG-index, p 0.002; DS-assay: median 45.2 versus 143 AU/mL, p 0.002). Persisting viral replication was not detected. Conclusions: Our data question the relevance and reliability of IgG antibody testing to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infections 6 weeks after an outbreak. We conclude that assessing immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection should not rely on antibody tests alone."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invasion in the central nervous system: a host-virus deadlock.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) devastation on the central nervous system (CNS) is ascertained by the present clinical findings and the noticeable signs and symptoms. The CNS involvement of the virus is not trivial; although the brain has highly protective systems, the virus has ways to breach them with a destructive potential. For successful entry of the virus, different possible routes with favorable mechanisms are used. The SARS-CoV-2 invasion induces a mechanism of both the innate and adaptive immune response to control virus replication and removal from the CNS tissues. The cytokine storm and autoimmune response during the immunological events result in demyelination, damage of resident cells and neurons, cerebrovascular thrombosis, and dysregulation of neuro signaling pathways. Furthermore, hypoxia and toxemia accelerate the neurological destruction process. The acute attributions on psychology due to inflammation is a hallmark of CNS involved pathogenesis; nevertheless, the productivity, durability, and longevity of virus-specific lymphocytes are the vital indicators for complete removal of viral antigen and in combat against reinfection of the CNS. Keywords: CNS invasion; immune response; cytokine storm; demyelination; mental status."
A Study of Universal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA Testing Among Residents and Staff in a Large Group of Care Homes in South London.,"Background: Care homes have experienced a high number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths among residents since the onset of the pandemic. However, up to May 2020, there has been a lack of information about the extent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among residents and staff in care homes and limited testing in this setting. Methods: Combined nose and throat swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out in 2455 residents and staff across 37 care homes in the London Borough of Bromley across a 3-week period. Results were reported within 24 hours of sample delivery, and data were collected on the presence or absence of symptoms. Results: Overall, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 6.5%, with a higher rate in residents (9.0%) than in staff (4.7%). A key finding was the high proportion of asymptomatic infection detected in staff (69%) and residents (51%), with evidence of underdetection of symptoms by care home staff. Conclusions: The high proportion of asymptomatic infection combined with underdetection of symptoms by care home staff indicates that offering a test to all residents and staff in care homes with rapid reporting of results would assist accurate identification of infected individuals, facilitating prompt infection prevention and control action."
Serial co-expression analysis of host factors from SARS-CoV viruses highly converges with former high-throughput screenings and proposes key regulators.,"The current genomics era is bringing an unprecedented growth in the amount of gene expression data, only comparable to the exponential growth of sequences in databases during the last decades. This data allow the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of heterogeneous and normalized transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and common transcriptional regulators in any biological model. The present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that are being generated, which could be used for validating results. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV viruses and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found 1899 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlaps with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with P-value near 0). Our results reveal a series of common regulators, involved in immune and inflammatory responses that might be key virus targets to induce the coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors."
Fractured aluminum nasopharyngeal swab during drive-through testing for COVID-19: radiographic detection of a retained foreign body.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the need for safe and efficient testing as a key containment strategy. Drive-through testing with nasopharyngeal swab has been implemented in many places in the USA as it allows for expeditious testing of large numbers of patients, limits healthcare workers' risk of exposure, and minimizes the use of personal protective equipment. We present a case where the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab fractured during specimen collection at a drive-through testing facility and was suspected to have remained in the asymptomatic patient. Initial evaluation with a series of radiographs covering the skull base, neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal the swab. On further clinical evaluation, the swab was found endoscopically, lodged between the left inferior turbinate and nasal floor, and was removed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases. Further evaluation with computed tomography or endoscopy should be considered in suspected cases where radiographs are negative."
[Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 - present experiences].,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new highly emerging and pathogenic for human RNA virus, is responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic. Molecular diagnostic methods, including real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay are the recommended methods for the identification and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 cases. RT-PCR allows for detection the RNA of the virus in clinical specimens from patients suspected of COVID-19 with high specificity and sensitivity. Testing is still crucial for rapid detection of infected persons, implementation of appropriate measures to suppress further virus transmission and mitigate its impact. In response to demand of a molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, within a first few months ongoing pandemic many commercial kits has become available on the market. However, these tests have varied in number and type of molecular targets, time of reaction as well as quality. In this study we compared different commercial tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples sending to Laboratory of Department of Virology, NIPH-NIH."
Antiviral drugs proposed for COVID-19: action mechanism and pharmacological data.,"Objective: As a beta-coronavirus, Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused one of the most significant historical pandemics, as well as various health and medical challenges. Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. Materials and methods: To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt. Conclusions: Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness."
[Follow-up testing of viral nucleic acid in discharged patients with moderate type of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)].,"Objective: To investigate the clinical outcome of patients with moderate type of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge by retesting viral nucleic acid. Methods: Seven patients with moderate COVID-19 met the discharge criteria enacted by National Health Commission were quarantine in hospital for 7 days, then continuously quarantined at home for 4 weeks after discharged. During the three weeks of quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented; and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method. Results: There were no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients. However, respiratory swabs from 3 patients were confirmed positive of SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid at 5 to 7 days after they met the discharge criteria. Conclusions: The study indicates that there is a relatively high incidence of positive viral nucleic acid in patients met the discharge criteria, and it is suggested that patients met the current discharge criteria should be quarantined in hospital for another 7 days and the follow-up viral testing is necessary."
Recent advances in therapeutic modalities and vaccines to counter COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the world. This resulted an alarming number of fatalities with millions of confirmed infected cases, pretending severe public health, economic, and social threats. There is no specific therapeutic drugs or licensed vaccines or treatments to fight against lethal COVID-19 infections. Given the significant threats of COVID-19, the global organizations are racing to identify epidemiological and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 to find treatment regimens and effective therapeutic modalities for future prevention. Herein, we reviewed the therapeutic interventions and vaccines for COVID-19 based on the existing knowledge and understanding of similar coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The information constitutes a paramount intellectual basis to sustenance ongoing research for the discovery of vaccines and therapeutic agents. This review signifies the most available frontiers in the viral vaccine development approaches to counter the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2."
What defines an efficacious COVID-19 vaccine? A review of the challenges assessing the clinical efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.,"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally. An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, ""Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?"""

SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a high-risk category during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis, with frontline HCWs at emergency departments (EDs) may be at an even higher risk. Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt. Methods: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. Results: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR. This illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs regardless of symptoms, and the need for strict measures in securing HCWs to reduce transmission from healthcare facilities to the community during the current pandemic."
New molecular diagnostic technologies for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an ongoing pandemic of new coronavirus pneumonia (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19). The virus has a long incubation period and strong infectivity, which poses a major threat to global health and safety. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid lies at the center of rapid detection of COVID-19, which is instrumental for mitigation of the ongoing pandemic. As of August 17, 2020, The National Medical Products Administration in China has approved 15 new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kits, 10 kits of which are based on reverse transcription-real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology. The remaining kits use five molecular diagnostic technologies different from RT-qPCR. This article reviews the principles, reaction time, advantages and disadvantages of above 15 detection kits, in order to provide references for rapid screening, diagnosis, prevention and control of COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases."
"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant, breastfeeding, and nonpregnant reproductive-aged women.","Background: Although mass vaccination against COVID-19 may prove to be the most efficacious end to this deadly pandemic, there remain concern and indecision among the public toward vaccination. Because pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aimed at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. Objective: This study aimed to understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, nonpregnant, and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Study design: We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers, and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in 1 of 3 ways: by email, advertisement flyers, and distribution of quick response codes at virtual town halls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups: (1) nonpregnant respondents, (2) pregnant respondents, and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. Results: The survey was administered from January 7, 2021, to January 29, 2021, with 1012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2%) as non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 25-47 years). Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were nonpregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant, and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). A total of 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Nonpregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%; P<.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%; P<.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents, and Spanish-speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination (Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. Conclusion: In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-Asian races were more likely to decline vaccination than nonpregnant and breastfeeding respondents. Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine acceptance."
"Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Prisons, England, 2020.","Using laboratory data and a novel address matching methodology, we identified 734 cases of coronavirus disease in 88 prisons in England during March 16-October 12, 2020. An additional 412 cases were identified in prison staff and household members. We identified 84 prison outbreaks involving 86% of all prison-associated cases."
SARS-CoV-2 and human milk: What is the evidence?,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as one of the most compelling and concerning public health challenges of our time. To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical and public health communities has rapidly engaged to collectively find answers and solutions. One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are likely. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk. Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk. These reports are evaluated here, and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of coronaviruses (in particular, SARS-CoV-2) during breastfeeding are discussed."
Understanding perception and acceptance of Sinopharm vaccine and vaccination against COVID-19 in the UAE.,"Background: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the world has reached an important milestone where vaccinations are discovered and are proven to be effective against SARS-COV-2 infections. Though vaccines against COVID-19 are now available, around the globe there is some hesitancy in getting the vaccine. This hesitancy to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is a complex phenomenon with various factors playing a role. This study aims at understanding the perception and expectations of the people about COVID-19 vaccine and the factors influencing the vaccine acceptance. This information is crucial to challenge vaccine hesitancy and to win the combat against the COVID-19 Pandemic through voluntary vaccine efforts. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among the residents of the UAE to understand the expectations and perception on vaccination against COVID-19. The survey was conducted online, and the survey design included participant samples to be representative of UAE's demographics. The results of the survey were analysed with various demographical variables of interest. Results: The survey showed that people were more likely to get vaccinated when vaccines are (i) endorsed by trusted government health authorities, (ii) recommended by physicians and family doctors, and (iii) the merits are effectively communicated through government websites and trusted news channels. Availability of vaccines at multiple sites and providing vaccines free of charges are likely to improve the rate of vaccination. The perceptions, expectations and the motivational factors needed for people to get vaccinated differed with age, gender, marital status, income level, and employment status. Conclusion: To attain herd immunity against COVID-19, a large proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated and to achieve this the vaccination campaigns should target on specific expectations and motivational factors pertaining to each target group to successfully overcome the challenge of vaccine hesitancy."
Proficiency testing and ring trials.,"The validation of diagnostic methods (and the subsequent results generated by a laboratory) are improved through participation in inter-laboratory comparisons (IC), such as proficiency-testing (PT) programmes and other exercises referred to as 'ring tests' or 'ring trials' (RTs). This is a requirement to comply with international quality standards. Validating a method is a continuous process and taking part in ongoing PT programmes supports the management of a method's life cycle, providing continuing assessment of fitness (sometimes referred to as the 'validation retention status'). Proficiency-testing panel designs ensure that the methods used, particularly diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, are suitably challenged. Appraising PT results over time can illustrate whether the laboratory's performance is stable, improving or worsening, and proficiency tests can also highlight variations in the performance of assays. The development of new proficiency tests can support the implementation of novel diagnostics technologies, such as whole genome sequencing and point-of-care testing, and assist in cross-sectoral partnerships focusing on One Health approaches, which are high on the agenda for infectious disease control. For example, the rapid design and distribution of emergency exempted assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means that these assays were not as rigorously evaluated as assays for established infectious diseases. Therefore, participation in PT programmes for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the performance of these assays. While other mechanisms help to underpin laboratory activities, PT has been, and should remain, an integral part of laboratory quality assurance. Resources must be directed towards increasing and improving the quality of PT (for example, availability and accessibility of suitable biological and reference materials are essential for a PT provider to execute its duties), to support established and novel methods such as genomic and point-of-care tests."
B Cell Response to Vaccination.,"As one of the most important weapons against infectious diseases, vaccines have saved countless lives since their first use in the late eighteenth century. Antibodies produced by effector B cells upon vaccination play a critical role in mediating protection. The past several decades of research have led to a revolution in our understanding of B cell response to vaccination. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were developed at an unprecedented speed to power our global fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we still face many challenges in the development of vaccines against many other deadly viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on B cell response to vaccination and pathogen infection. We also discuss the current challenges in the field and the potential strategies targeting B cell response to improve vaccine efficacy.Key abbreviations box: BCR: B cell receptor; bNAb: broadly neutralizing antibody; DC: dendritic cells; DZ: dark zone; EF response: extrafollicular response; FDC: follicular dendritic cell; GC: germinal center; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; IC: immune complex; LLPC: long-lived plasma cell; LZ: light zone; MBC: memory B cell; SLPB: short-lived plasmablast; TFH: T follicular helper cells; TLR: Toll-like receptor."
Evaluating the Virucidal Activity of Disinfectants According to European Union Standards.,"The disinfection of surfaces in medical facilities is an important element of infection control, including the control of viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Preparations used for surface disinfection are typically characterized via their activity against test organisms (i.e., viruses, bacteria and fungi) in the laboratory. Typically, these methods use a suspension of the test organism to assess the bactericidal, fungicidal or virucidal activity of a given preparation. However, such suspension methods do not fully imitate real-life conditions. To address this issue, carrier methods have been developed, in which microorganisms are applied to the surface of a carrier (e.g., stainless steel, glass and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and then dried. Such methods more accurately reflect the applications in real-life clinical practice. This article summarizes the available methods for assessing the virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants for use in medical facilities based on the current European standards, including the activity against coronaviruses."
Impact of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases on the severity of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We examined the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension and diabetes on the development of severe COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive, systematic literature search for studies published between December 2019 and July 5, 2020 in five databases. The prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes was evaluated through a meta-analysis. Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results. Our findings suggest patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes are at greater risk for developing severe COVID-19 than those without these conditions."
"Man-Specific Lectins from Plants, Fungi, Algae and Cyanobacteria, as Potential Blockers for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronaviruses: Biomedical Perspectives.","Betacoronaviruses, responsible for the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"" (SARS) and the ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"" (MERS), use the spikes protruding from the virion envelope to attach and subsequently infect the host cells. The coronavirus spike (S) proteins contain receptor binding domains (RBD), allowing the specific recognition of either the dipeptidyl peptidase CD23 (MERS-CoV) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2 (SARS-Cov, SARS-CoV-2) host cell receptors. The heavily glycosylated S protein includes both complex and high-mannose type N-glycans that are well exposed at the surface of the spikes. A detailed analysis of the carbohydrate-binding specificity of mannose-binding lectins from plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria, revealed that, depending on their origin, they preferentially recognize either complex type N-glycans, or high-mannose type N-glycans. Since both complex and high-mannose glycans substantially decorate the S proteins, mannose-specific lectins are potentially useful glycan probes for targeting the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. Mannose-binding legume lectins, like pea lectin, and monocot mannose-binding lectins, like snowdrop lectin or the algal lectin griffithsin, which specifically recognize complex N-glycans and high-mannose glycans, respectively, are particularly adapted for targeting coronaviruses. The biomedical prospects of targeting coronaviruses with mannose-specific lectins are wide-ranging including detection, immobilization, prevention, and control of coronavirus infection."
"Differences in COVID-19 Testing and Test Positivity Among Veterans, United States, 2020.","Objective: COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States. We evaluated characteristics associated with obtaining a COVID-19 test from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and receiving a positive test result for COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. Results: In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. Conclusions: Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence."
COVID-19 in Patients with Cancer: A Retrospective Study of 212 Cases from a French SARS-CoV-2 Cluster During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"We describe a large series of patients with solid tumors in an early COVID-19 cluster in the eastern part of France. From February to May 2020, this multicenter retrospective study enrolled 212 patients with cancer under treatment or on follow-up for any type of malignant solid tumor and positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mortality rate was 30%. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers were identified as a subset of more vulnerable patients; immunotherapy and radiotherapy within 3 months from COVID-19 diagnosis were risk factors for death. The reported data support the essential need to be proactive and weigh the risks of morbidity from COVID-19 against the magnitude of benefits of intended cancer therapies during this pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article supports the essential need to be proactive (treatment delay or modification) in oncology in the setting of pandemic. This study identified patients with gastrointestinal cancers as a more vulnerable subset of patients with cancer and found that immunotherapy and radiotherapy within 3 months from COVID-19 diagnosis to be risk factors for death. The reported data indicate the necessity of weighing the risks of morbidity from COVID-19 against the magnitude of benefits of intended cancer therapies in any future wave of COVID-19."
Replicability of studies following a dual-criterion design.,"Replicability of results is regarded as the corner stone of science. Recent research seems to raise doubts about whether this requirement is generally fulfilled. Often, replicability of results is defined as repeating a statistically significant result. However, since significance may not imply scientific relevance, dual-criterion study designs that take both aspects into account have been proposed and investigated during the last decade. Originally developed for proof-of-concept trials, the design could be appropriate for phase III trials as well. In fact, a dual-criterion design has been requested for COVID-19 vaccine applications by major health authorities. In this article, replicability of dual-criterion designs is investigated. It turns out that the probability to replicate a significant and relevant result can become as low as 0.5. The replication probability increases if the effect estimator exceeds the minimum relevant effect in the original study by an extra amount."
"Coronavirus disease 2019, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and immunosuppressive therapies - A Danish population-based cohort study.","Background: Limited data exist regarding the disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its relationship with immunosuppressants among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19, frequent rheumatological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and neurological IMIDs and immunosuppressants. Methods: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study including all residents living within Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand from January 28th, 2020 until September 15th, 2020 with the only eligibility criterion being a test for SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction. Main outcomes included development of COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. Results: COVID-19 was less common among patients with IMIDs than the background population (n = 328/20,513 (1.60%) and n = 10,792/583,788(1.85%), p < 0.01, respectively). However, those with IMIDs had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization (31.1% and 18.6%, p < 0.01, respectively) and mortality (9.8% and 4.3%, p < 0.01, respectively), which were associated with patients older than 65 years, and presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, systemic steroids were independently associated with a severe course of COVID-19 (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.56 (95%CI 1.83-7.10), p < 0.01), while biologic therapies were associated with a reduced risk hereof (OR = 0.47 (95%CI 0.22-0.95), p = 0.04). Patients suspending immunosuppressants due to COVID-19 had an increased risk of subsequent hospitalization (OR = 3.59 (95%CI 1.31-10.78), p = 0.02). Conclusion: This study found a lower occurrence, but a more severe disease course, of COVID-19 among patients with IMIDs, which was associated with the use of systemic steroids for IMIDs and suspension of other immunosuppressants. This study emphasizes the importance of weighing risks before suspending immunosuppressants during COVID-19."
Diagnostic Salivary Tests for SARS-CoV-2.,"The diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection relies on the detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) performed with respiratory specimens, especially nasopharyngeal swabs. However, this procedure requires specialized medical personnel, centralized laboratory facilities, and time to provide results (from several hours up to 1 d). In addition, there is a non-negligible risk of viral transmission for the operator who performs the procedure. For these reasons, several studies have suggested the use of other body fluids, including saliva, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen has numerous advantages: it is easily self-collected by the patient with almost no discomfort, it does not require specialized health care personnel for its management, and it reduces the risks for the operator. In the past few months, several scientific papers, media, and companies have announced the development of new salivary tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Posterior oropharyngeal saliva should be distinguished from oral saliva, since the former is a part of respiratory secretions, while the latter is produced by the salivary glands, which are outside the respiratory tract. Saliva can be analyzed through standard (rRT-PCR) or rapid molecular biology tests (direct rRT-PCR without extraction), although, in a hospital setting, these procedures may be performed only in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs to minimize the incidence of false-negative results. Conversely, the promising role of saliva in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the emergence of point-of-care technologies and, most important, point-of-need devices. Indeed, these devices can be directly used in workplaces, airports, schools, cinemas, and shopping centers. An example is the recently described Rapid Salivary Test, an antigen test based on the lateral flow assay, which detects the presence of the virus by identifying the spike protein in the saliva within a few minutes."
Cardiac sequelae after coronavirus disease 2019 recovery: a systematic review.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been implicated in a wide spectrum of cardiac manifestations following the acute phase of the disease. Objectives: To assess the range of cardiac sequelae after COVID-19 recovery. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Scopus (inception through 17 February 2021) and Google scholar (2019 through 17 February 2021). Study eligibility criteria: Prospective and retrospective studies, case reports and case series. Participants: Adult patients assessed for cardiac manifestations after COVID-19 recovery. Exposure: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed by PCR. Methods: Systematic review. Results: Thirty-five studies (fifteen prospective cohort, seven case reports, five cross-sectional, four case series, three retrospective cohort and one ambidirectional cohort) evaluating cardiac sequelae in 52 609 patients were included. Twenty-nine studies used objective cardiac assessments, mostly cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in 16 studies, echocardiography in 15, electrocardiography (ECG) in 16 and cardiac biomarkers in 18. Most studies had a fair risk of bias. The median time from diagnosis/recovery to cardiac assessment was 48 days (1-180 days). Common short-term cardiac abnormalities (<3 months) included increased T1 (proportion: 30%), T2 (16%), pericardial effusion (15%) and late gadolinium enhancement (11%) on CMR, with symptoms such as chest pain (25%) and dyspnoea (36%). In the medium term (3-6 months), common changes included reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (30%) and late gadolinium enhancement (10%) on CMR, diastolic dysfunction (40%) on echocardiography and elevated N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (18%). In addition, COVID-19 survivors had higher risk (risk ratio 3; 95% CI 2.7-3.2) of developing heart failure, arrythmias and myocardial infarction. Conclusions: COVID-19 appears to be associated with persistent/de novo cardiac injury after recovery, particularly subclinical myocardial injury in the earlier phase and diastolic dysfunction later. Larger well-designed and controlled studies with baseline assessments are needed to better measure the extent of cardiac injury and its clinical impact."
Development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and has rapidly spread through many countries globally. The causative SARS-CoV-2 virus was not known until recently, and there is little or no natural immunity in human populations. There is an urgent need for vaccines and drugs to combat this new pandemic. In just a few months, huge efforts and resources by government, academia, and industry have been thrown into the race to develop a vaccine. This brief review summarizes and discusses the array of technologies being applied to vaccine development, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches."
[Infection prevention in dental care during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2].,"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease with widespread transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. Some of those infected become seriously ill. Others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to the transmission of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is excreted in the oral cavity and can be spread via aerosols. Therefore, there is an increased risk of its spread during aerosol-producing treatments in dental care clinics. Due to the risk of infection of dental care workers and patients, and based on the evidence currently available, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing emergency dental care in this phase of the pandemic. Other treatments should be postponed. Based on guidance in scientific literature and advice from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), consideration should be given to what infection control measures are necessary when providing emergency and regular dental care in both the current situation and in the future."
"SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Pregnant and Postpartum Women, Kenya, 2020-2021.","We determined incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza virus infections among pregnant and postpartum women and their infants in Kenya during 2020-2021. Incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was highest among pregnant women, followed by postpartum women and infants. No influenza virus infections were identified."
Recommendations for use of antigenic tests in the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second pandemic wave: attitude in different clinical settings.,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very ""pointof-care"". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of COVID-19."
Molecular Insights into Small-Molecule Drug Discovery for SARS-CoV-2.,"The mainstream approach to antiviral drugs against COVID-19 is to focus on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The vast majority of candidates under investigation are repurposed from agents of other indications. Understanding protein-inhibitor interactions at the molecular scale will provide crucial insights for drug discovery to stop this pandemic. In this article, we summarize and analyze the most recent structural data on several viral targets in the presence of promising inhibitors for COVID-19 in the context of the perspective of modes of action (MOA) to unravel insightful mechanistic features with atomistic resolution. The targets include spike glycoprotein and various host proteases mediating the entry of the virus into the cells, viral chymotrypsin- and papain-like proteases, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The main purpose of this review is to present detailed MOA analysis to inspire fresh ideas for both de novo drug design and optimization of known scaffolds to combat COVID-19."
"The Algerian Chapter of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: An Evolutionary, Genetic, and Epidemiological Prospect.","To explore the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Algeria, a dataset comprising ninety-five genomes originating from SARS-CoV-2 sampled from Algeria and other countries worldwide, from 24 December 2019, through 4 March 2021, was thoroughly examined. While performing a multi-component analysis regarding the Algerian outbreak, the toolkit of phylogenetic, phylogeographic, haplotype, and genomic analysis were effectively implemented. We estimated the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) in reference to the Algerian pandemic and highlighted the multiple introductions of the disease and the missing data depicted in the transmission loop. In addition, we emphasized the significant role played by local and international travels in disease dissemination. Most importantly, we unveiled mutational patterns, the effect of unique mutations on corresponding proteins, and the relatedness regarding the Algerian sequences to other sequences worldwide. Our results revealed individual amino-acid replacements such as the deleterious replacement A23T in the orf3a gene in Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241. Additionally, a connection between Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and sequences originating from the USA was observed through a USA characteristic amino-acid replacement T1004I in the nsp3 gene, found in the aforementioned Algerian sequence. Similarly, successful tracing could be established, such as Algeria/G37318-8849/2020|EPI_ISL_766863, which was imported from Saudi Arabia during the pilgrimage. Lastly, we assessed the Algerian mitigation measures regarding disease containment using statistical analyses."
Evaluation of the Clinical Performance of 7 Serological Assays for SARS-CoV-2 for Use in Clinical Laboratories.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays have emerged as a response to the global pandemic, warranting studies evaluating their clinical performance. This study investigated 7 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in samples from noninfected individuals and hospitalized patients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 qualitative serological assays by Abbott (IgG), Beckman (IgG), DiaSorin (IgG), EUROIMMUN (IgG and IgA), Roche and Bio-Rad (Total) were evaluated using specimens collected pre-December 2019 (n = 393), from nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) negative patients (n = 40), and from 53 patients with COVID-19 by NAAT collected 3-21 days post-onset of symptoms (POS) (N = 83). Negative agreement (NA), positive agreement (PA), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) at prevalences of 5% and 10% were calculated. Results: The overall %NA; 95% CI in the negative samples were: Roche 99.8%; 99.3-100.2, Beckman 99.8%; 98.7-100.0, Abbott and Bio-Rad 99.3%; 98.0-99.9, DiaSorin 98.4; 97.2-99.6, EUROIMMUN IgG 97.5%; 95.5-98.7, and EUROIMMUN IgA 79.7%; 75.9-83.5), accounting for positive/equivocal results as false positives. The %PA; 95% CI in samples collected 14+ days POS (n = 24) were: Bio-Rad 83.3%; 68.4-98.2, Abbott and Roche 79.2%; 62.9-95.4, EUROIMMUN IgA 70.8%; 52.6-89.0, Beckman 58.3%; 38.6-78.1, DiaSorin 54.2; 34.2-74.1, and EUROIMMUN IgG 50.0%; 30.0-70.0, accounting for negative/equivocal results as false negatives. NPVs ranged from 97.4%-98.9% and 94.7%-97.7% for prevalences 5% and 10%, respectively. PPVs ranged from 15.5%-94.8% and 27.9%-97.4% for prevalences 5% and 10%, respectively. Conclusion: The Roche and Beckman assays resulted in fewer false positives, followed by the Bio-Rad and Abbott assays. While the Bio-Rad assay demonstrated higher antibody detection in COVID-19-positive patients, PA claims cannot be established with a high level of confidence in our sample population."
Design and in silico validation of polymerase chain reaction primers to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Accurate designing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeting conserved segments in viral genomes is desirable for preventing false-negative results and decreasing the need for standardization across different PCR protocols. In this work, we designed and described a set of primers and probes targeting conserved regions identified from a multiple sequence alignment of 2341 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). We subsequently validated those primers and probes in 211,833 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences. We obtained nine systems (forward primer + reverse primer + probe) that potentially anneal to highly conserved regions of the virus genome from these analyses. In silico predictions also demonstrated that those primers do not bind to nonspecific targets for human, bacterial, fungal, apicomplexan, and other Betacoronaviruses and less pathogenic sub-strains of coronavirus. The availability of these primer and probe sequences will make it possible to validate more efficient protocols for identifying SARS-CoV-2."
The Impact of COVID-19 in Gastroenterology and Hepatology.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an airborne infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We have reviewed current literature to describe the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology and hepatology as well as targets of future research."
Catch Me if You Can: Superspreading of COVID-19.,"While significant insights have been gained concerning COVID-19, superspreading of coronaviruses remains a mystery. The vast majority of cases have been linked to a relatively small portion of infected individuals. Yet, the genetic sequence of the virus, severity of disease, and underlying host parameters, such as age, sex, and health conditions, are not clearly driving the superspreading phenomenon. In this commentary we discuss what is known and what is not known about coronavirus superspreader transmission and explore whether characteristics of the virion, the donor, or the environment contribute to this phenomenon."
Lack of Informations about COVID-19 Vaccine: From Implications to Intervention for Supporting Public Health Communications in COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Lack of knowledge and mistrust towards vaccines represent a challenge in achieving the vaccination coverage required for population immunity. The aim of this study is to examine the opinion that specific demographic groups have about COVID-19 vaccination, in order to detect potential fears and reasons for negative attitudes towards vaccination, and to gain knowledge on how to prepare strategies to eliminate possible misinformation that could affect vaccine hesitancy. The data collection approach was based on online questionnaire surveys, divided into three groups of questions that followed the main postulates of the health belief theory-a theory that helps understanding a behaviour of the public in some concrete surrounding in receiving preventive measures. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the influence of individual factors on refusing the vaccine, and to provide information on the perception of participants on the danger of COVID-19 infection, and on potential barriers that could retard the vaccine utility. There was an equal proportion of participants (total number 276) who planned on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (37%), and of those who did not (36.3%). The rest (26.7%) of participants were still indecisive. Our results indicated that attitudes on whether to receive the vaccine, on how serious consequences might be if getting the infection, as well as a suspicious towards the vaccine efficacy and the fear of the vaccine potential side effects, may depend on participants' age (<40 vs. >40 years) and on whether they are healthcare workers or not. The barriers that make participants' unsure about of receiving the vaccine, such as a distrust in the vaccine efficacy and safety, may vary in different socio-demographic groups and depending on which is the point of time in the course of the pandemic development, as well as on the vaccine availability and experience in using certain vaccine formulas. There is a pressing need for health services to continuously provide information to the general population, and to address the root causes of mistrust through improved communication, using a wide range of policies, interventions and technologies."
Outcomes from an infectious disease physician-guided evaluation of hospitalized persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at a large US academic medical center.,We describe an approach to the evaluation and isolation of hospitalized persons under investigation (PUIs) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at a large US academic medical center. Only a small proportion (2.9%) of PUIs with 1 or more repeated severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) after a negative NAAT were diagnosed with COVID-19.
Posterior Oropharyngeal Saliva for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put tremendous pressure on the healthcare system worldwide. Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Methods: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between 1 February 2020 and 15 April 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. Results: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 nasopharyngeal specimens (NPsp). Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.1-67.6%) and 53.3% (95% CI 46.8-59.6%). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI 70.2-80.9%), 65.4% (95% CI 55.5-74.2%), 85.2% (95% CI 77.4-90.8%). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within 7 days (96.6%, 95% CI 87.3-99.4%) compared with after 7 days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI 61.4-85.2%). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the 2 specimen types. Conclusions: POPS is an acceptable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2."
Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in a child with nasal foreign body.,"While children, particularly infants, are susceptible to severe and critical COVID-19 disease, over 55% of pediatric cases are present in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children. Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viral particles remain viable for up to 3 hours, raising concern about risk to healthcare workers during aerosol generating procedures (APGs) in the airway and nasopharynx. Herein we describe the first case of a nasal foreign body in an asymptomatic child with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discuss management of this child and highlight the importance of considering asymptomatic infection and preoperative testing when planning procedures of the airway in the COVID-19 era."
COVID-19 Vaccines in Children with Cow's Milk and Food Allergies.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most challenging global health crisis of our times. Vaccination against COVID-19 plays a key role to control the current pandemic situation. The risk of allergic reactions to new COVID-19 vaccines is low. However, there is a debate on the safety in allergic patients following post marketing findings by different agencies. Our aim is to understand from current experiences whether children with cow's milk or food allergy are at higher risk than a general population for allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Current data indicate that patients with a history of allergy to cow's milk or other foods, even if severe, should receive COVID-19 vaccine in a setting with availability of treatments for anaphylactic reactions and under medical supervision. Recipients should be discharged after a protracted observation period of 30 min if no reaction developed."
At what times during infection is SARS-CoV-2 detectable and no longer detectable using RT-PCR-based tests? A systematic review of individual participant data.,"Background: Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are pivotal to detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and duration of detectable virus indicating potential for infectivity. Methods: We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv, and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Results: Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from - 6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 and 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Conclusions: RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond 10 days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias, so the positivity rates are probably overestimated."
Vaccines for COVID-19.,"Since the emergence of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of 2019, there has been an explosion of vaccine development. By 24 September 2020, a staggering number of vaccines (more than 200) had started preclinical development, of which 43 had entered clinical trials, including some approaches that have not previously been licensed for human vaccines. Vaccines have been widely considered as part of the exit strategy to enable the return to previous patterns of working, schooling and socializing. Importantly, to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic, production needs to be scaled-up from a small number of preclinical doses to enough filled vials to immunize the world's population, which requires close engagement with manufacturers and regulators. It will require a global effort to control the virus, necessitating equitable access for all countries to effective vaccines. This review explores the immune responses required to protect against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology. We describe the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The review also addresses the critical steps between promising preclinical leads and manufacturing at scale. The issues faced during this pandemic and the platforms being developed to address it will be invaluable for future outbreak control. Nine months after the outbreak began we are at a point where preclinical and early clinical data are being generated for the vaccines; an overview of this important area will help our understanding of the next phases."
Potential Implications of Black Seed and its Principal Constituent Thymoquinone in the Treatment of COVID-19 Patients.,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The progression of COVID-19 is related to an excessive host inflammatory immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is considered a major cause of disease severity and death. Dysregulated immune response produces huge amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines called ""cytokine storm"". Moreover, the activation of microthrombi formation plays an important role in multiple organ failure. Methods: Keeping into consideration the potent anti-inflammatory activity of black seed and its major constituent Thymoquinone (TQ), we hypothesize their potential implication in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus electronic databases using the terms, including black seed, N. sativa, thymoquinone, SARSCoV- 2, COVID-19 and inflammatory immune response. Results: Various studies confirmed that Black seed and TQ reduced the thrombus formation, the expression of tissue factor and the immune activation. Furthermore, TQ demonstrated the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that may be effective in controlling the secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Keeping into consideration the multi-targeting nature of the black seed and TQ, they may be used as a potential therapeutic formulation or as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients."
"Consideration Of Value-Based Pricing For Treatments And Vaccines Is Important, Even In The COVID-19 Pandemic.","Prices send signals about consumer preferences and thus stimulate producers to make more of what people want. Pricing in a pandemic is complicated and fraught. The policy puzzle involves balancing lower prices to ensure access to essential medications, vaccines, and tests against the need for adequate revenue streams to provide manufacturers with incentives to make the substantial, risky investments needed to develop products in the first place. We review alternative pricing strategies (cost recovery models, monetary prizes, and advance market commitments) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Hybrid pricing strategies are undoubtedly needed in a pandemic, but even in a public health crisis, value-based pricing is important. Cost-effectiveness analyses can inform pricing. Ideally, analyses would be conducted from both a health system and a societal perspective. Incorporating the added value of social benefits into cost-effectiveness analyses does not mean that manufacturers should capture the entire societal benefit of a diagnostic, vaccine, or therapy. Such analyses can provide important information and help policy makers consider the full costs and benefits of products and the wide-ranging ramifications of their actions."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates.,"Background: Pregnant women and their neonates represent 2 vulnerable populations with an interdependent immune system that are highly susceptible to viral infections. The immune response of pregnant women to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects the neonatal passive immunity have not been studied systematically. Objective: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with the maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity that the neonate received from the mother. Study design: Women who gave birth and who tested positive for immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using semiquantitative detection in a New York City hospital between March 22, 2020, and May 31, 2020, were included in this study. A retrospective chart review of the cases that met the inclusion criteria was conducted to determine the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the use of oxygen support. Serology levels were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using a Welch 2 sample t test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted to identify the dates of self-reported onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the timing of the peak immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody levels after symptom onset was visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing on log2-scaled serologic values. To study the neonatal serology response, umbilical cord blood samples of the neonates born to the subset of serology positive pregnant women were tested for serologic antibody responses. The maternal antibody levels of serology positive vs the maternal antibody levels of serology negative neonates were compared using the Welch 2 sample t test. The relationship between the quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using a Pearson correlation and linear regression. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine the predictors of neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. Results: A total of 88 serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. The antibody levels were higher in symptomatic pregnant women than in asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data revealed that the maternal immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels peak around 15 and 30 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, studies of 50 neonates born to this subset of serology positive women showed that passive immunity in the form of immunoglobulin G is conferred in 78% of all neonates. The presence of passive immunity is dependent on the maternal antibody levels, and the levels of neonatal immunoglobulin G correlate with maternal immunoglobulin G levels. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. Conclusion: We demonstrated that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive neonatal immunity. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predicted the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. These data will further guide the screening for this uniquely linked population of mothers and their neonates and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies."
A Level 1 Trauma Center's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City: a qualitative and quantitative story.,"Background: The purpose of this study is to describe a Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare outcomes of acute fracture patients pre-COVID versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All inpatient fracture cases performed over a 5-month period were identified and retrospective chart review performed. Patients were divided into pre- and COVID-era groups based on when surgery was performed relative to March 16, 2020 (the date elective operations were ceased), and groups were statistically compared. Patients with a COVID test result were further sub-divided into COVID negative and positive groups, and statistically compared. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were identified, 38% females with average age of 58 years. Average length of stay was 7 days with average time from injury to surgery of 3 days and average time from admission to surgery of 1.3 days. Overall in-hospital complication rate was 29.4%, and 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 2.5% and 5%, respectively. Sixty-nine patients comprised the pre-COVID group, and 50 in the COVID-era group. There was no significant difference with respect to length of stay, time from injury to surgery, time from admission to surgery, need for post-operative ICU stay, in-hospital complication rate, 30-day mortality rate and 30-day readmission rate. Thirty-four patients had COVID testing, with 24 negative and 10 positive. COVID-positive patients had longer time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.003) and longer time from admission to surgery (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days, p = 0.034). While more COVID-positive patients required ICU admission post-operatively (60% vs. 21%, p = 0.036), there was no difference in overall complication rate. Conclusions: Orthopedic care of acute fracture patients was not affected by a global pandemic. The response of our Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic department can guide other hospitals if and when new surges in COVID cases arise, in order to prevent compromising appropriate orthopedic care. Level of evidence: Prognostic III."
Strategies used to meet the challenges of mass COVID-19 vaccination by the pharmacy department in a large academic medical center.,"Purpose: Highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have brought hope for ending the pandemic. Unprecedented mass vaccination started first among healthcare workers. The aim of this report is to describe key strategies undertaken by a large hospital pharmacy department to meet the challenges of preparing a large quantity of COVID-19 vaccine doses in a short period of time. Summary: MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) was in the first group of hospitals in Washington, DC, to receive Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December 2020. The pharmacy department faced challenges including stringent vaccine storage requirements, a need for specific equipment and workflow, limited funding, and staffing constraints. The pharmacy department's senior leaders defined pharmacy responsibilities, budgeted for equipment, participated in vaccination center design, and instructed pharmacy informatics personnel. The vaccine coordinators were appointed to oversee all vaccination-related operations. An ultra-low temperature freezer was installed 2 weeks before arrival of the first shipment of vaccine. All pharmacy order entry tools and operating procedures were standardized, and staff training and schedules were finalized by December 15. The first dose of the vaccine was administered on December 16 at the vaccination center. Pharmacy staff members dispensed the vaccine doses and monitored patients. By January 6, 2021, MWHC had vaccinated 3,812 employees with their first vaccine dose, with an average of 228 doses administered daily. Conclusion: Key strategies such as systemic coordination, early preparation, detailed planning, operating procedure development, and staff education and engagement proved successful in facilitating preparation of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses for hospital employees within a short period of time."
"Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus in Patient with Pneumonia, China.","We report co-infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus in a patient with pneumonia in China. The case highlights possible co-detection of known respiratory viruses. We noted low sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2, which could further complicate recognition of the full extent of disease."
Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective.,"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced."
"University students' perspectives, planned uptake, and hesitancy regarding the COVID-19 vaccine: A multi-methods study.","Purpose: To investigate university students' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. Method: A multi-methods approach was used-online convenience sample surveys and semi-structured interviews-of young adults attending a large Canadian public university. Two survey samples were collected (June 20-July 28, 2020 and September 22-October 17, 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted following each survey, interviewing 20 students in each round. Results: In June 77.8% of surveyed students (n = 483) were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine; in September 79.6% were willing (n = 1269). Multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses found that increasing perception of the severity of COVID-19 predicted the likelihood that a respondent was willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine in both surveys. In the latter survey students who indicated they would be encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine if their doctor/pharmacist recommended it were 76 times more likely to be willing to get the vaccine than those who would not be encouraged by medical advice. Interviews revealed concerns about the speed of the vaccine roll out, safety, and efficacy. Conclusions: The majority of university students intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. Ensuring that family doctors, pharmacists, and other front-line healthcare workers have consistent and clear information regarding the benefits of vaccination will be critical to encouraging uptake among young adults."
[Replication and transmission mechanisms of highly pathogenic human coronavirus].,"The three known highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins, accessory proteins and ribonucleic acid. Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response. Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates. Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes. This review discusses the mechanisms of replication and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses providing basis for future studies on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of these pathogenic viruses."
Domains and Functions of Spike Protein in Sars-Cov-2 in the Context of Vaccine Design.,"The spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor to gain entry into a cell to initiate infection. Both Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine candidates are based on stabilized mRNA encoding prefusion SARS-2-S that can be produced after the mRNA is delivered into the human cell and translated. SARS-2-S is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, with S1 serving the function of receptor-binding and S2 serving the function of membrane fusion. Here, I dissect in detail the various domains of SARS-2-S and their functions discovered through a variety of different experimental and theoretical approaches to build a foundation for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how SARS-2-S works to achieve its function of mediating cell entry and subsequent cell-to-cell transmission. The integration of structure and function of SARS-2-S in this review should enhance our understanding of the dynamic processes involving receptor binding, multiple cleavage events, membrane fusion, viral entry, as well as the emergence of new viral variants. I highlighted the relevance of structural domains and dynamics to vaccine development, and discussed reasons for the spike protein to be frequently featured in the conspiracy theory claiming that SARS-CoV-2 is artificially created."
Factors associated with the duration of hospitalisation among COVID-19 patients in Vietnam: A survival analysis.,"Background: The median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10-13 days. Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. Method: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. Results: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. Conclusion: A close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period."
"Applications of laboratory findings in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of COVID-19.","The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents us with a serious public health crisis. To combat the virus and slow its spread, wider testing is essential. There is a need for more sensitive, specific, and convenient detection methods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Advanced detection can greatly improve the ability and accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, which is conducive to the early suitable treatment and supports precise prophylaxis. In this article, we combine and present the latest laboratory diagnostic technologies and methods for SARS-CoV-2 to identify the technical characteristics, considerations, biosafety requirements, common problems with testing and interpretation of results, and coping strategies of commonly used testing methods. We highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity and propose potential solutions to provide cutting-edge technical support to achieve a more precise diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 and to overcome the difficulties with the normalization of epidemic prevention and control."
SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development: Current Status.,"In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and its attendant morbidity and mortality, safe and efficacious vaccines are needed that induce protective and long-lived immune responses. More than 120 vaccine candidates worldwide are in various preclinical and phase 1 to 3 clinical trials that include inactivated, live-attenuated, viral-vectored replicating and nonreplicating, protein- and peptide-based, and nucleic acid approaches. Vaccines will be necessary both for individual protection and for the safe development of population-level herd immunity. Public-private partnership collaborative efforts, such as the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines mechanism, are key to rapidly identifying safe and effective vaccine candidates as quickly and efficiently as possible. In this article, we review the major vaccine approaches being taken and issues that must be resolved in the quest for vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019. For this study, we scanned the PubMed database from 1963 to 2020 for all publications using the following search terms in various combinations: SARS, MERS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, clinical trial, coronavirus, pandemic, and vaccine development. We also did a Web search for these same terms. In addition, we examined the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public health authority websites. We excluded abstracts and all articles that were not written in English."
Are COVID-19 test results masking important issues?,"Basic health and infection control measures are the main methods of protection against COVID-19. Patients are well informed about how practitioners should be conducting themselves, however, they may lose trust in clinicians who fail to demonstrate, and promote those same basic prevention measures. The broader COVID-19 strategy has included the rapid development and deployment of swabs and antibody tests. Flaws in testing fail to offer assurances due to false negatives while even true positives cannot guarantee future immunity as there is uncertainty regarding long-term antibody response. An understanding of human factors and an appreciation of the limitations of available tests could offer healthcare staff mechanisms to encourage safety."
Correlation of Neuroimaging Findings with Clinical Presentation and Laboratory Data in Patients with COVID-19: A Single-Center Study.,"Background: This study was aimed at revealing neuroimaging findings in COVID-19 patients and at discussing their relationship with epidemiological data and some laboratory parameters. Materials and Method. This study included 436 cases of COVID-19 and 40 cases of non-COVID-19 acute/subacute thromboembolism who underwent at least one neuroimaging procedure due to neurological symptoms between April 2020 and December 2020. The group of COVID-19-positive acute/subacute thromboembolism cases was compared with both the group of normal brain imaging cases and the non-COVID-19 acute/subacute thromboembolism group in terms of demographic data and laboratory parameters. Results: When the acute/subacute thromboembolism group and neuroimaging findings were compared in terms of negative group, presence of comorbid disease, D-dimer level, and lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients, a statistically significant difference was found (p = 0.047, 0.014, and <0.001, respectively). COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative acute/subacute thromboembolism cases that were compared in terms of gender, neuroimaging reason, C-reactive protein, D-dimer level and lymphocyte count, a statistically significant difference was found (p = 0.003, <0.001, 0.005, 0.02, and <0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Acute thromboembolic events are common in patients with COVID-19 due to a potentially increased procoagulant process. Neurological evaluation and, if necessary, detailed neuroimaging should be performed, especially in cases with high D-dimer levels."
[Key Points for Quality Control of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Testing Kits].,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the accurate and rapid clinical diagnosis technology of SARS-CoV-2 has played a crucial role in the prevention and control of epidemic situation. This study aims to analyze and discuss the key points for quality control of 2019 novel coronavirus testing kits, while incorporating the actual testing process, the distribution of testing kits and interpretation of relevant policies and regulations."
Clinical Performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Tests Using an Automated Chemiluminescent Assay.,"Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to support nucleic acid testing for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is useful for documenting previous exposures to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The sensitivities of the chemiluminescent SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM immunoassay were assessed by using serum samples collected from 728 patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The specificity was evaluated on a panel of 60 serum samples from non-COVID-19 patients with high levels of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, or antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), mycoplasma pneumonia, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza A or influenza B. The imprecision and interference were assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A2 and EP7-A2, respectively. Sensitivities between 1 and 65 days after onset of symptoms were 94.4% and 78.7%, for IgG and IgM test, respectively. The sensitivity increased with the time after symptom onset, and rose to the top on the 22nd to 28th days. The total imprecision (CVs) was less than 6.0% for IgG and less than 6.5% for IgM. Limited cross-reactions with antibodies against EBV, CMV, mycoplasma pneumonia, human RSV, adenovirus, influenza A or influenza B were found. These data suggested the chemiluminescent SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, assay with reliable utility and sensitivity, could be used for rapid screening and retrospective surveillance of COVID-19."
COVID-19 vaccine design: the Janus face of immune enhancement.,Previous work on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccines identified cellular immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement as potential safety issues. We discuss the implications of these findings for COVID-19 vaccine development and our approach to optimizing for safety and efficacy.
Engineering luminescent biosensors for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.,"Current serology tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies mainly take the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays or lateral flow assays, which are either laborious, expensive or lacking sufficient sensitivity and scalability. Here we present the development and validation of a rapid, low-cost, solution-based assay to detect antibodies in serum, plasma, whole blood and to a lesser extent saliva, using rationally designed split luciferase antibody biosensors. This new assay, which generates quantitative results in 30 min, substantially reduces the complexity and improves the scalability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody tests. This assay is well-suited for point-of-care, broad population testing, and applications in low-resource settings, for monitoring host humoral responses to vaccination or viral infection."
COVID-19 Encephalitis with SARS-CoV-2 Detected in Cerebrospinal Fluid Presenting as a Stroke Mimic.,"We report the case of a 35-year-old male with COVID-19 encephalitis presenting as a stroke mimic with sudden-onset expressive and receptive dysphasia, mild confusion and right arm incoordination. The patient received thrombolysis for a suspected ischaemic stroke, but later became febrile and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Electroencephalography demonstrated excess in slow waves, but neuroimaging was reported as normal. Respiratory symptoms were absent throughout and nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. At the most recent follow-up, the patient had made a full neurological recovery. Clinicians should therefore consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in patients who present with acute focal neurology, confusion and fever during the pandemic, even when there is no evidence of respiratory infection."
Prioritizing the First Doses of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine to Save the Elderly: The Case Study of Italy.,"SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing hundreds of deaths every day in European countries, mostly in not yet vaccinated elderly. Vaccine shortage poses relevant challenges to health authorities, called to act promptly with a scarcity of data. We modeled the mortality reduction of the elderly according to a schedule of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that prioritized first dose administration. For the case study of Italy, we show an increase in protected individuals up to 53.4% and a decrease in deaths up to 19.8% in the cohort of over 80's compared with the standard vaccine recalls after 3 or 4 weeks. This model supports the adoption of vaccination campaigns that prioritize the administration of the first doses in the elderly."
Evaluation of extraction-free RT-qPCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.,"Extraction-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is currently the ""gold standard"" in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. However, some extraction-free RT-qPCR techniques have recently been developed. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of traditional extraction-based, heated extraction-free, and unheated extraction-free RT-qPCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic individuals. The unheated extraction-free method showed perfect agreement with the standard extraction-based RT-qPCR. By contrast, the heat-treated technique was associated with an 8.2% false negativity rate. Unheated extraction-free RT-qPCR for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable alternative to the traditional extraction-based methods and may accelerate turnaround times by about two hours."
Current understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on gastrointestinal disease: Challenges and openings.,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. In March 2019 the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. COVID-19 patients typically have a fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and anosmia. Some patients also report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities. Surprisingly, many studies have found severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in rectal swabs and stool specimens of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In addition, viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine-type 2, were also found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can dynamically infect and replicate in both GI and liver cells. Taken together these results indicate that the GI tract is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present review summarizes the vital information available to date on COVID-19 and its impact on GI aspects."
Contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in patient surroundings and on personal protective equipment in a non-ICU isolation ward for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status.,"Objectives: We performed an environmental sampling study to investigate the environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status of clinical samples. Methods: We sampled the air from rooms for nine COVID-19 patients with illness or positive PCR > 30 days, before and after nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbing and before and after nebulization treatment. We also sampled patients' surroundings and healthcare workers' personal protection equipment (PPE) in a non-ICU ward. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR. Results: Eighty-eight samples were collected from high-touch surfaces and floors in patient rooms and toilets, with only the bedsheets of two patients and one toilet positive for SARS-CoV-2. All air samples (n = 34) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Fifty-five samples collected from PPE were all negative. Conclusion: Contamination of near-patient surroundings was uncommon for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status if environmental cleaning/disinfection were performed rigorously. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely in these non-ICU settings."
Trigeminal neuralgia as the sole neurological manifestation of COVID-19: A case report.,"Objective: To describe a case report of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Background: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Respiratory system manifestations are dominant in this new disease. However, numerous case series and reviews have been published on the neurological manifestations, highlighting the potential neurotropism of the new coronavirus. Methods: We describe a clinical case of TN during COVID-19 and we discuss the differential diagnosis and the potential pathogenic mechanism according to the literature. Results: A 65-year-old man with general malaise and typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, who presented with paroxysmal lancinating pain in the right V1 trigeminal territory without other neurological symptoms. General blood test and neuroimaging study were normal. A rapid test showed positive IgG and IgM serologies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient was diagnosed with TN secondary to a viral infection by SARS-CoV-2. Facial pain resolved with the improvement of COVID-19. Conclusions: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a possible etiology of secondary TN. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to elucidate the neuropathology of this viral infection."
Is Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Possible in Preterm Triplet Pregnancy? A Case Series.,"There is limited data regarding the vertical transmission (VT) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection. We report the first case of VT in preterm triplet pregnancy, with all triplets positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 at 20 hours and day 5 of life. This report reiterates the need for an expedited formulation of a simple, standardized, and reproducible international case definition and classification for VT."
Clinical usefulness of fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative antibody measurements in COVID-19 patients.,"Since December 2019, we have been in the battlefield with a new threat to the humanity, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by viral pneumonia. It may be asymptomatic or cause various symptoms, ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. At present, the only reliable test for COVID-19 diagnosis is quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Assessing the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 could increase the detection sensitivity of infected population. Hereby, we report the performances of a fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) on 276 serum samples. One hundred samples obtained from COVID-19 negative subjects (COVID-19 free) were analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic specificity of antibody (Ab) detection. Thereafter, 176 samples obtained from 125 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 patients) were selected to assess the diagnostic sensitivity of the CLIA. All samples were analyzed on MAGLUMI 800 platform. All COVID-19 free samples had Ab levels below the cutoff values. Hence, the diagnostic specificity was estimated at 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.3-100.0; positive predictive value = 100%). By the 18th day from the onset of symptoms, we reached an optimal diagnostic sensitivity (more than 95.0%) In fact, the diagnostic sensitivity increased over time and between 15 and 25 days after symptoms onset, reached 95.5% (95% CI = 84.9-99.2). The new automated CLIA analyzer appeared to be a robust and reliable method to measure specific Ab against COVID-19 at high throughput. Our data suggest that combining Ab and nucleic acid detection could increase diagnostic sensitivity."
"COVID-19 Outbreak on a Passenger Ship and Assessment of Response Measures, Greece, 2020.","We describe response measures to an outbreak involving 128 (33.4%) coronavirus disease cases (46.1% asymptomatic) among 383 persons onboard a passenger ship. Multivariate analysis indicated that dining in certain rooms and bar areas, nationality, working department (for crew members), and quarantining onboard the ship were significantly associated with infection."
Point Prevalence Testing of Residents for SARS-CoV-2 in a Subset of Connecticut Nursing Homes.,This study describes the point prevalence of polymerase chain reaction tests positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among residents of a sample of Connecticut nursing homes in the first half of May 2020.
"Shotgun transcriptome, spatial omics, and isothermal profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals unique host responses, viral diversification, and drug interactions.","In less than nine months, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) killed over a million people, including >25,000 in New York City (NYC) alone. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies."
Effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine in Preventing Severe Symptomatic Infection among Healthcare Workers.,"Background and Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in preventing severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed infection among healthcare workers in a real-world scenario. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study was conducted. Subjects with onset illness from January to February 2021 were eligible and classified according to the number of vaccine doses received (single-shot, n = 8; two-shot, n = 12; unvaccinated, n = 290). Results: The vaccine effectiveness against severe illness was 100% in the single and two-shot group. The presented results suggest that vaccination reduces the frequency of severe symptomatic COVID-19 in working-age adults. Conclusions: Efforts focusing on maximizing the number of immunized subjects in the study population may reduce associated economic and social burdens."
Global seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Many studies report the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. Results: We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5%, IQR 2.4-8.4%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6% perinatal) to high (59% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p<0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p<0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95% CI 2.64-4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.96-3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95% CI 1.01-32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.60-2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95% CI 1.28-3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9-38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames. Discussion: Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response."
Assessing the Knowledge and Attitude toward COVID-19 Vaccination in Saudi Arabia.,"COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The most promising strategy to control the pandemic was to develop a vaccine. However, vaccination hesitancy is a major threat to world public health. Understanding the reasons behind this hesitancy might help in developing encouragement strategies. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1599 responses were received; the overall vaccine acceptancy was 79.2%. Age, sex, and nationality of participants significantly predicted the vaccination status. A significantly higher proportion of participants, who reported being vaccinated, or intended to receive the vaccine, stated that the COVID-19 infection is dangerous, or varies from person to person; the vaccine is safe, and think there is a definite need for the vaccine (p < 0.001). The major encouragement factors to receive the vaccine were either confidence in the government decisions (54.8%), or the feeling of responsibility to stop the pandemic (48.7%), whereas the main discouraging factors were concerns about the insufficient clinical trials (11.4%), or the undiscovered side effects (11%). The results of this study indicate good acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine among residents of Saudi Arabia."
A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match all currently circulating variants.,"The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in >5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages."
Clinical Characteristics and Mortality of Health-Care Workers With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in Mexico City.,"Background: We evaluated the risk of death for health-care workers (HCW) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Mexico City during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and describe the associated factors in hospitalized HCW, compared with non-HCW. Methods: We analyzed data from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases registered from 27 February-31 August 2020 in Mexico City's public database. Individuals were classified as non-HCW or HCW (subcategorized as physicians, nurses, and other HCW). In hospitalized individuals, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the potential factors associated with death and compare mortality risks among groups. Results: A total of 125 665 patients were included. Of these, 13.1% were HCW (28% physicians, 38% nurses, and 34% other HCW). Compared with non-HCW, HCW were more frequently female, were younger, and had fewer comorbidities. Overall, 25 771 (20.5%) were treated as inpatients and 11 182 (8.9%) deaths were reported. Deaths in the total population (9.9% vs 1.9%, respectively; P < .001) and in hospitalized patients (39.6% vs 19.3%, respectively; P < .001) were significantly higher in non-HCW than in HCW. In hospitalized patients, using a multivariate model, the risk of death was lower in HCW in general (odds ratio [OR], 0.53) than in non-HCW, and the risks were also lower by specific occupation (OR for physicians, 0.60; OR for nurses, 0.29; OR for other HCW 0.61). Conclusions: HCW represent an important proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City. While the mortality risk is lower in HCW compared to non-HCW, a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients was observed in this study. Among HCW, nurses had a lower risk of death compared to physicians and other HCW."
Application of Biosafety Principles in Laboratory Analysis of Clinical Samples from Patients with COVID-19.,"COVID-19 poses a great challenge to clinical and diagnostic services around the world. The need of biosafety practices can never be emphasised more than under current circumstances. The four pillars of biosafety namely, leadership, standard operating procedures, personal protective equipment (PPE) and engineering controls must be employed for effective and safe practices in the clinical setting in general and laboratory settings in particular. Risk assessment must be carried out before meeting up the diagnostic challenge for COVID-19 and essential biorisk management measures are required to be taken. In our resource-poor settings, we need to adapt safe but cost-effective and improvised solutions to ensure safe handling of clinical samples from COVID-19 patients in the laboratories. The correct use of PPE and their suitable alternatives are available for selection and use. Disinfection of the lab areas and safe disposal of the clinical samples from such patients is also of paramount importance."
Organ recovery from deceased donors with prior COVID-19: A case series.,"Although guidance documents have been published regarding organ donation from individuals with a prior history of COVID-19 infection, no data exist regarding successful recovery and transplantation from deceased donors with a history of or positive testing suggesting a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report a case series of six deceased donors with a history of COVID-19 from whom 13 organs were recovered and transplanted through several of the nation's organ procurement organizations (OPOs). In addition, at least two potential donors were authorized for donation but with no organs were successfully allocated and did not proceed to recovery. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from the six donors to recipients, procurement teams, or hospital personnel. Although more studies are needed, organ donation from deceased donors who have recovered from COVID-19 should be considered."
COVID-19: Why does disease severity vary among individuals?,"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While all people are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the nature and severity of the disease vary significantly among individuals and populations. Importantly, reported disease burdens and case fatality rates differ considerably from country to country. There are, however, still uncertainties about the severity of the disease among individuals or the reason behind a more severe disease in some cases. There is a strong possibility that the severity of this disease depends on a complicated interaction between the host, virus, and environment, which leads to different clinical outcomes. The objective of this article is to point out the essential influential factors related to the host, virus, and environment affecting the clinical outcome of COVID-19."
Evaluation of the Truvian Easy Check COVID-19 IgM/IgG Lateral Flow Device for Rapid Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Detection.,"Objectives: To evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the Truvian Easy Check coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) IgM/IgG anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody test.Serologic assays have become increasingly available for surveillance through the Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization in the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. However, widespread application of serologic assays has been curbed by reports of faulty or inaccurate tests. Therefore, rapid COVID-19 antibody tests need to be thoroughly validated prior to their implementation. Methods: The Easy Check device was analytically evaluated and its performance was compared with the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay. The test was further characterized for cross-reactivity using sera obtained from patients infected by other viruses. Clinical performance was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed samples and a 2015 prepandemic reference sample set. Results: The Easy Check device showed excellent analytical performance and compares well with the Roche Elecsys antibody assay, with an overall concordance of 98.6%. Clinical performance showed a sensitivity of 96.6%, a specificity of 98.2%, and an overall accuracy of 98.1%. Conclusions: The Easy Check device is a simple, reliable, and rapid test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, and its performance compares favorably against the automated Roche Elecsys antibody assay."
Comparison of three TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2.,"Quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for COVID-19 control. Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LoD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LoD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92 % and 100 %, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60 %), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64 %) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48 % and 20 %, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2."
Insights on 3D Structures of Potential Drug-targeting Proteins of SARS-CoV-2: Application of Cavity Search and Molecular Docking.,"The emergence of the COVID-19 has caused public health problems worldwide and there is no effective pharmacological treatment for this disease. Research on 3D models of proteins and the search for active molecular sites are important tools to assist in the discovery of effective antiviral drugs to combat COVID-19. To address this problem, the 3D protein structures of SARS-CoV 2 were analyzed and submitted to cavities research, evaluation of their druggabillity and liganbility, and applied to molecular docking studies with potential ligand candidates actually assayed against COVID-19. Eight druggable potential cavity sites were determined in model structures' PDB code, 6W4B, 6VWW, 6W01, 6M3M, and 6VYO, and these are the good alternatives to be characterized as targets for antiviral compounds. The good cavity model of the protease 3D structure was used in molecular docking, and this allowed verifying the theoric interactions of this protein and lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs. These results may assist in the use of 3D protein models in drug design studies aiming to develop drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic."
The Alpha Variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 in Children: First Experience from 3544 Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests in a Cohort of Children in Germany.,"In May 2021, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 91% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany. Not much is known about the symptoms, courses of disease, and infectiousness in pediatric patients with the Alpha variant. Objective: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to gain information on the infection with the Alpha variant in children and adolescents. Methods: Between 12 January 2021 and 3 June 2021, all nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of children who received a swab for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Data were collected on standardized questionnaires. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Results: We investigated 3544 NAATs; 95 children were tested positive (2.7%) for SARS-CoV-2. For the sub-analysis, 65 children were analyzed. In 59 children, the Alpha variant was found (90.8%), and 54.2% (n = 32/59) were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and rhinitis. The median Ct value was 24.0 (min 17.0; max 32.7). Conclusions: We can underline early findings that children are still less effected by SARS-CoV-2 infection with the spread of the Alpha variant. We found no evidence that children infected with the Alpha variant showed more severe symptoms or suffered from a more severe clinical course than those infected with the wild type."
Molecular Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution is expected, given the nature of virus replication. Selection and establishment of variants in the human population depend on viral fitness and on molecular and immunological selection pressures. Here we discuss how mechanisms of replication and recombination may contribute to the emergence of current and future variants of SARS-CoV-2."
Universal Sars-Cov-2 Screening in Pregnant Women: Experience from the Italian Epidemic Outbreak.,"Background and aim: Sars-CoV-2 infection has rapidly spread worldwide following the first cases reported in China. Piacenza is one of the most affected cities in Italy. Many infections occurred in the hospital due to the high frequency of patients and healthcare professionals interaction. The aim of the work is to evaluate advantages of universal screening for Sars-Cov-2 in pregnant women admitted to a hospital setting and calculate frequency of infection in an obstetrical population. Methods: all pregnant women attending Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Piacenza from 22nd April to 18th June 2020 were screened for Sars-Cov-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: 240 pregnant women were tested upon admission: all twelve (5%) testing positive were asymptomatic. None of the positive asymptomatic women developed COVID-19 symptoms or adverse perinatal outcomes. Conclusions: the diagnosis of asymptomatic pregnant women through universal screening provides the opportunity to protect mothers, babies and heath care workers. In accordance with other studies, our findings add to the growing body of evidence showing high rates of asymptomatic infection in the healthcare setting and highlight a critical need for universal screening of pregnant women."
"Prevalence of anosmia among COVID-19 patients in Taif City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.","Objectives: To assess the prevalence of anosmia in coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) patients. Coronavirus-19-related anosmia and hyposmia is a new emerging concept in the medical literature. Methods: A retrospective study on COVID-19 patients with anosmia and hyposmia was performed during the period between May-July, 2020. The inclusion criteria were all clinically stable COVID-19 patients less than 15 years old with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patients who refused to participate or leave incomplete questions were excluded. In this study, we investigated 1022 patients who met our criteria. Results: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) was reported by 53% of our COVID-19 patients, of which 32.7% were anosmic and 20.3% were hyposmic. Other neurological symptoms included ageusia (51.4%), fatigue (63%), myalgia (59.2%), and headache (50.9%), all of which showed significant association with OD. In addition, anosmia had a significant association with young age and female gender. However, there was no association between OD and pre-existing neurological disease. Conclusion: Half of our COVID-19 patients presented OD (anosmia/hyposmia), which often associated with ageusia and many neurological symptoms."
[SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and reaction of the immune system. Can the epidemic spread of the virus be prevented by vaccination?].,"Since the end of 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world partially associated with a high death toll. Besides hygienic measurements to reduce the spread of the virus vaccines have been confected, partially based on the experiences with Ebola virus vaccine, based on recombinant human or chimpanzee adenovirus carrying the spike protein and its ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Further vaccines are constructed by spike protein coding mRNA incorporated in lipid nano vesicles that after entry in human cells produce spike protein. Both vaccine types induce a strong immune response that lasts for months possibly for T-cell immunity a few years. Due to mutations in the coronavirus genome in several parts of the world variants selected, that were partially more pathogenic and partially easier transmissible - variants of concern (VOC). Until now vaccinees are protected against the VOC, even when protection might be reduced compared to the Wuhan wild virus.An open field is still how long the vaccine induced immunity will be sufficient to prevent infection and/or disease; and how long the time period will last until revaccination will be required for life saving protection, whether a third vaccination is needed, and whether revaccination with an adenovirus-based vaccine will be tolerated."
A database resource and online analysis tools for coronaviruses on a historical and global scale.,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a new zoonotic origin coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) has sound the alarm for the potential spread of epidemic coronavirus crossing species. With the urgent needs to assist disease control and to provide invaluable scientific information, we developed the coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomic, proteomic and evolutionary analysis platform. CoVdb has brought together genomes of more than 5000 coronavirus strains, which were collected from 1941 to 2020, in more than 60 countries and in hosts belonging to more than 30 species, ranging from fish to human. CoVdb presents comprehensive genomic information, such as gene function, subcellular localization, topology and protein structure. To facilitate coronavirus research, CoVdb also provides flexible search approaches and online tools to view and analyze protein structure, to perform multiple alignments, to automatically build phylogenetic trees and to carry on evolutionary analyses. CoVdb can be accessed freely at http://covdb.popgenetics.net. Hopefully, it will accelerate the progress to develop medicines or vaccines to control the pandemic of COVID-19."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challenges.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond."
Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.,"The global COVID-19 pandemic remains challenging with efforts for community vaccination the primary strategy to control transmission and disease sequalae in the mid to long term. While several candidate vaccines have been approved for use, there is an ongoing discussion regarding potential vaccine-related adverse events. Notably, thrombotic thrombocytopaenia has been reported following ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccination. We report the first known case of takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy 4 days after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a 72-year-old man. While this condition remains one primarily seen in females, our case represents a new trigger that warrants careful consideration when assessing patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination."
"Scalable, Micro-Neutralization Assay for Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies in Human Clinical Samples.","As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expanded, it was clear that effective testing for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of convalescent patients would be critical for development of plasma-based therapeutic approaches. To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants. By February 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 FRNA had been used to screen over 5000 samples, including acute and convalescent plasma or serum samples and therapeutic antibody treatments, for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers."
"COVID-19 in Health-Care Workers: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prevalence, Risk Factors, Clinical Characteristics, and Outcomes.","Health-care workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), being at a higher risk of acquiring the disease and, subsequently, exposing patients and others. Searches of 8 bibliographic databases were performed to systematically review the evidence on the prevalence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs. A total of 97 studies (all published in 2020) met the inclusion criteria. The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from HCWs' samples, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the presence of antibodies, was 11% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7, 15) and 7% (95% CI: 4, 11), respectively. The most frequently affected personnel were nurses (48%, 95% CI: 41, 56), whereas most of the COVID-19-positive medical personnel were working in hospital nonemergency wards during screening (43%, 95% CI: 28, 59). Anosmia, fever, and myalgia were the only symptoms associated with HCW SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among HCWs positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 40% (95% CI: 17, 65) were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis. Finally, severe clinical complications developed in 5% (95% CI: 3, 8) of the COVID-19-positive HCWs, and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.02, 1.3) died. Health-care workers suffer a significant burden from COVID-19, with those working in hospital nonemergency wards and nurses being the most commonly infected personnel."
Performance of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests for Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Prospectively Pooled Specimens.,"Pooled nucleic acid amplification tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could increase availability of testing at decreased cost. However, the effect of dilution on analytical sensitivity through sample pooling has not been well characterized. We tested 1,648 prospectively pooled specimens by using 3 nucleic acid amplification tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: a laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting the envelope gene, and 2 commercially available Panther System assays targeting open reading frame 1ab. Positive percent agreement (PPA) of pooled versus individual testing ranged from 71.7% to 82.6% for pools of 8 and from 82.9% to 100.0% for pools of 4. We developed and validated an independent stochastic simulation model to estimate effects of dilution on PPA and efficiency of a 2-stage pooled real-time reverse transcription PCR testing algorithm. PPA was dependent on the proportion of tests with positive results, cycle threshold distribution, and assay limit of detection."
COVID-19 related callback in blood donors; Outcomes in blood donors and patients.,"Call back as a procedure to report post donation symptoms or illness by donors has been established since 2009 in Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). During the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak, all blood donors were requested to report any respiratory infection symptoms after donation. The study investigated the callback data of COVID-19 in Tehran Blood Center during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Iran. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of post donation COVID-19 related call back reports and determine its implications for blood donors and patients. A telephone interview was conducted with donors who had reported COVID-19 symptoms. Some questions were asked to evaluate donor's health at the time of blood donation. The donors categorized into three groups: laboratory-confirmed, suspected, and COVID-19 irrelevant based on their answers. In cases that the blood component obtained from a laboratory-confirmed donor had been released, the hospital was notified and asked to follow up the recipient for COVID-19. The results showed 30 donors (0.08 %) had callback related to COVID-19 and 76.63 % of the obtained component was disposed. The results also showed that only one donor had a laboratory-confirmed result with the RBC unit processed from her whole blood released for transfusion. The RBC unit recipient did not show any signs or symptoms of infection during a 46-day follow-up. Concluded that callback system was effective to remove most of the components obtained from the donors who reported to be COVID-19 suspected or confirmed. Moreover, the result did not support virus transmission through blood transfusion."
Quantifying the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness.,"The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is poorly known. Using data from a cohort of cases and high-risk contacts, we reconstructed viral load at the time of contact and inferred the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was larger in household contacts than in non-household contacts, with a transmission probability as large as 48% when the viral load was greater than 1010 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset, with a mean probability of transmission of 29%, with large individual variations. The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by two- to eightfold with variants of concern and assuming no changes in the pattern of contacts across variants, the model predicts that larger viral load levels could lead to a relative increase in the probability of transmission of 24% to 58% in household contacts, and of 15% to 39% in non-household contacts."
Older Adults' Behavior Intentions Once a COVID-19 Vaccine Becomes Available.,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of antecedent variables on older adults' intention to get a CORONAVIRUS DISEASE-2019 vaccine. Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from the disease and face an increasingly ageist general population who misrepresent the pandemic as an older adult problem. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior framework to examine vaccine behavior intention. Method: A convenience sample (n = 583) of adults aged 60 and older in the United States participated in an online survey using vignettes. Hierarchical regression and analysis of covariance were used to test our model. Results: Results suggest that perceived risk of the pandemic, general vaccine beliefs, and political affiliation influence respondents' attitude toward the vaccine. Respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine and their physician's recommendation help shape vaccine intention. Conclusion: The results provide partial support to the proposed model in shaping vaccine intention among older adults."
Therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells in multiple organs affected by COVID-19.,"Currently, the world has been devastated by an unprecedented pandemic in this century. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been causing disorders, dysfunction and morphophysiological alterations in multiple organs as the disease evolves. There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 impact to lungs, kidneys, heart, vasculature and central nervous system while discussing promising MSC's therapeutic mechanisms in each tissue. In addition, MSC's therapeutic effects in high-risk groups for COVID-19, such as obese, diabetic and hypertensive patients are also explored."
COVID-19 risk in elective surgery during a second wave: a prospective cohort study.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected access to elective surgery, largely because of concerns for patients and healthcare workers. A return to normal surgery workflow depends on the prevalence and transmission of coronavirus in elective surgical patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of active SARS-coronavirus-2 infection during a second wave among patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery in Victoria. Methods: Prospective cohort study across eight hospitals in Victoria during July-August 2020 was conducted enrolling adults and children admitted to hospital for elective surgery or interventional procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Study outcomes included a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 in the preoperative period (primary outcome), and for those with a negative test preoperatively, the incidence of a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in the post-operative period. Results: We enrolled 4965 elective adult and paediatric surgical patients from 15 July to 31 August 2020. Four patients screened negative on questionnaire but had a positive PCR test for coronavirus, resulting in a Bayesian estimated prevalence of 0.12% (95% probability interval 0-0.26%). There were no reports of healthcare worker infections linked to elective surgery during and up to 2 weeks after the study period. Conclusion: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic elective surgical patients during a second wave was approximately 1 in 833. Given the very low likelihood of coronavirus transmission, and with existing current hospital capacity, recommencement of elective surgery should be considered. A coronavirus screening checklist should be mandated for surgical patients."
The Sensitivity and Costs of Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Saliva Versus Nasopharyngeal Swabs : A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Background: Nasopharyngeal swabs are the primary sampling method used for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they require a trained health care professional and extensive personal protective equipment. Purpose: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. Data sources: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. Study selection: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Data extraction: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). Data synthesis: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. Limitation: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. Conclusion: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Use of connected digital products in clinical research following the COVID-19 pandemic: a comprehensive analysis of clinical trials.,"Objectives: In an effort to mitigate COVID-19 related challenges for clinical research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidance for the conduct of 'virtual' clinical trials in late March 2020. This study documents trends in the use of connected digital products (CDPs), tools that enable remote patient monitoring and telehealth consultation, in clinical trials both before and after the onset of the pandemic. Design: We applied a comprehensive text search algorithm to clinical trial registry data to identify trials that use CDPs for remote monitoring or telehealth. We compared CDP use in the months before and after the issuance of FDA guidance facilitating virtual clinical trials. Setting: All trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with start dates from May 2019 through February 2021. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the overall percentage of CDP use in clinical trials started in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset (May 2019-February 2020) compared with the 10 months following (May 2020-February 2021). Secondary outcome measures included CDP usage by trial type (interventional, observational), funder type (industry, non-industry) and diagnoses (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 participants). Results: CDP usage in clinical trials increased by only 1.65 percentage points, from 14.19% (n=23 473) of all trials initiated in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset to 15.84% (n=26 009) of those started in the 10 months following (p<0.01). The increase occurred primarily in observational studies and non-industry funded trials and was driven entirely by CDP usage in trials for COVID-19. Conclusions: These findings suggest that in the short-term, new options created by regulatory guidance to stimulate telehealth and remote monitoring were not widely incorporated into clinical research. In the months immediately following the pandemic onset, CDP adoption increased primarily in observational and non-industry funded studies where virtual protocols are likely medically necessary due to the participants' COVID-19 diagnosis."
Monitoring Serum Spike Protein with Disposable Photonic Biosensors Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.,"While mRNA vaccines have been well-studied in vitro and in animals prior to their use in the human population during the Covid-19 pandemic, their exact mechanisms of inducing immunity are still being elucidated. The large-scale collection of data necessary to fully understand these mechanisms, and their variability across heterogeneous populations, requires rapid diagnostic tests that accurately measure the various biomarkers involved in the immune response following vaccination. Recently, our lab developed a novel ""Disposable Photonics"" platform for rapid, label-free, scalable diagnostics that utilizes photonic ring resonator sensor chips combined with plastic micropillar cards able to provide passive microfluidic flow. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this system in confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the serum of recently vaccinated subjects, as well as tracking a post-vaccination rise in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A maximum concentration in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected one day after vaccination and was reduced below detectable levels within 10 days. This highlights the applicability of our rapid photonic sensor platform for acquiring the data necessary to understand vaccine mechanisms on a large scale, as well as individual patient responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines."
Dermatological manifestations during COVID-19 and histological picture: Description of two clinical cases.,"It is not yet entirely clear what is the relevance of skin symptoms and what clinical implications are related to their appearance in COVID-19 patients. We describe two cases of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, which presented skin manifestations in advanced stage of illness, when nasopharyngeal swabs became negative for SARS-CoV-2. The first case presented erythematous, maculopapular lesions; the second developed petechial, vesicular and blood-encrusted lesions on the limbs. Histopathology documented perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, with prevalent CD4+ T-cells in both patients. The research of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues with real time RT-PCR was negative. Basal keratinocytes displayed C4d deposits in one case, who developed laboratory signs indicative of a procoagulative condition at the same time as the skin rash. Skin manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection seem to be clinically relevant and further studies are necessary to assess if they are linked to systemic complications, lack of viral clearance or cascades of immune responses induced by the virus, even in patients affected by mild pneumonia."
Highlight of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 vaccine development against COVID-19 pandemic.,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought an unprecedented impact upon the global economy and public health. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virology has been gradually investigated, measures to combat this new threat in public health are still absent. To date, no certificated drug or vaccine has been developed for the treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease Extensive researches and international coordination has been conducted to rapidly develop novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several major breakthroughs have been made through the identification of the genetic sequence and structural/non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which enabled the development of RNA-, DNA-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and attenuated viral vaccines. In this review article, we present an overview of the recent advances of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the challenges that may be encountered in the development process, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches that may help in effectively countering COVID-19."
Prevalence of COVID-19 Virus Infection in Semnan province.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) causing a human pandemic disease named COVID-19 has become a major global health concern. Iran as one of the most affected countries needs unprecedented effort for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. Objective: To determine the seroprevalance of COVID-19 in Semnan province North-East of Iran. Methods: Six hundred people were randomly selected using the ""SIB data-base"". From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province. Results: Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons). Approximately 10% of participants had detectable antibodies but showed a negative-PCR result. However, approximately 80% of participants did not show an evidence of infection. Conclusion: The majority of the population in Semnan province has no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, Semnan is considered a SARS-CoV-2 susceptible area. These results emphasize the need for maintaining public health measures to tackle the new epidemic wave."
Nondetection of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces of public areas next to COVID-19 hospitalization units.,"We studied the contamination with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the bacterial load of high-touch surfaces located in public areas next to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization units. Ninety-two samples were obtained from 46 different high-touch surfaces: 36 sites next to COVID-19 hospitalization units and 10 sites in the cabins of the public elevators. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected at any site, despite high bacterial loads suggested that the studied sites had been frequently touched prior to the sampling."
ELISA detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in saliva.,"To facilitate containment of the COVID-19 pandemic currently active in the United States and across the world, options for easy, non-invasive antibody testing are required. Here we have adapted a commercially available, serum-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for use with saliva samples, achieving 84.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity in a set of 149 clinical samples. This strategy will enable widespread, affordable testing for patients who experienced this disease, whilst minimizing exposure risk for healthcare workers."
Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 using Immuno RNA-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization.,"This manuscript provides a protocol for in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) coupled with immunofluorescence to visualize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in cell line and three-dimensional (3D) cultures of human airway epithelium. The method allows highly specific and sensitive visualization of viral RNA by relying on HCR initiated by probe localization. Split-initiator probes help amplify the signal by fluorescently labeled amplifiers, resulting in negligible background fluorescence in confocal microscopy. Labeling amplifiers with different fluorescent dyes facilitates the simultaneous recognition of various targets. This, in turn, allows the mapping of the infection in tissues to better understand viral pathogenesis and replication at the single-cell level. Coupling this method with immunofluorescence may facilitate better understanding of host-virus interactions, including alternation of the host epigenome and immune response pathways. Owing to sensitive and specific HCR technology, this protocol can also be used as a diagnostic tool. It is also important to remember that the technique may be modified easily to enable detection of any RNA, including non-coding RNAs and RNA viruses that may emerge in the future."
A Review on Screening Models for Potential Therapeutic Candidates and Targets Against SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronaviruses are a group of known RNA virus which primarily infect the respiratory tract, and also neurological, enteric, and hepatic systems. Endemic outbreaks of Middle East Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been observed in recent decades. A new strain named the SARS CoV-2(- COVID-19) virus has now spread across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable and has culminated in a massive pandemic of COVID-19. Currently, no successful treatment is available. Therefore, an urgent need is there for new screening models that can aid in identifying the drugs with potential activity against COVID-19. The current review aims to discuss various in-silico, in- -vitro and in-vivo screening methods that can potentially be used to expedite the discovery of new active therapeutic candidates and vaccines, drug targets, and repurposing the commercially available drugs against COVID-19 for the effective management of the infection and thereby controlling this pandemic. Further, the current status of drugs and vaccines under clinical investigation has been summarized."
Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Antibody Detection Results for SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid test (NAT) has become the standard method to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, there are still many limitations, especially the problem of the high false negative rate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 NAT and evaluate the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody detection in novel coronavirus infection. Methods: A total of 10309 suspected or high-risk cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Hubei, China, were tested for virus NAT by RT-PCR. Among those cases, 762 COVID-19 patients and 143 patients with non-COVID-19 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG during the NAT period were screened. The difference between the two test methods was analyzed using the chi-square test. Results: The positive rate of 10309 cases was about 36% (95% CI: 33.39%-39.67%). SARS-CoV-2 was present in various types of specimens, and alveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate [52.38% (95% CI: 31.02-73.74)]. The clinical sensitivity of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG was 77.17% (588/762) and 94.88% (723/762), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 93.71% (134/143) and 90.21% (129/143). The area under the curve (AUC) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and combination of IgG with IgM were equally larger than IgM [0.973 (95% CI: 0.964-0.983) vs 0.930 (95% CI: 0.910-0.949)]. IgG antibody had the highest specificity [100.0% (95% CI: 100.00%-100.00%)] and sensitivity [94.0% (95% CI: 92.45%-95.55%)] when detected alone or in combination with IgM antibody. The total coincidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and SARS-CoV-2 NAT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92.04% (833/905). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2 NAT-negative patients with clinical symptoms and CT imaging features, 29 (85.29%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and 31 (91.76%) were positive for IgG. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 NAT should be considered for many types of specimens, and the combined test of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can make up for the problem of missed NAT in COVID-19 patients."
Retrospective analysis of the first 50 emergency/elective surgical cases in terms of mortality and morbidity in CoVid-19 Pandemic Hospital in Istanbul.,"2019-nCoV currently named SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic Coronavirus identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. Turkey declared the first case relatively late compared to Asian and European countries on March 11, as the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Turkey. In this study, we aimed to determine patients' outcomes in 50 surgeries done in the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 50 patients who underwent surgeries during the incubation period of CoVid-19 at Istinye University Gaziosmanpasa Medical Park Hospital in Istanbul, from March 2 to April 11, 2020. Results: The age of 50 patients range was 21 to 73, and the median age was 43.32 (64%) patients were women. The median length of hospital stay is 2.6 days (1-21). Operations at various difficulty levels were also performed on patients with co-morbidities. No complication or mortality was observed except for 1 patient, and the ICU requirement of that patient was also due to high energy trauma. Conclusion: Although contrary claims have been made in various studies; it is the primary duty of us surgeons to operate CoVid-19 positive/suspicious patients safely and without any contamination, and on the other hand, to continue their operations without victimizing negative patients. In this pilot study, we would like to emphasize with necessary and adequate measures these can be achieved. Key words: CoVid-19, SARS-CoV-2, Surgery."
Eating meat and not vaccinating: In defense of the analogy.,"The devastating impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is prompting renewed scrutiny of practices that heighten the risk of infectious disease. One such practice is refusing available vaccines known to be effective at preventing dangerous communicable diseases. For reasons of preventing individual harm, avoiding complicity in collective harm, and fairness, there is a growing consensus among ethicists that individuals have a duty to get vaccinated. I argue that these same grounds establish an analogous duty to avoid buying and eating most meat sold today, based solely on a concern for human welfare. Meat consumption is a leading driver of infectious disease. Wildlife sales at wet markets, bushmeat hunting, and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are all exceptionally risky activities that facilitate disease spread and impose immense harms on human populations. If there is a moral duty to vaccinate, we also should recognize a moral duty to avoid most meat. The paper concludes by considering the implications of this duty for policy."
Who should be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination?,"The development of COVID-19 vaccines is occurring at a rapid pace, with the potential for a vaccine to be available within 6 months. So who should be prioritized for vaccination when in the first instance, there will be insufficient supply to meet demand? There is no doubt that health-care workers in all settings should be vaccinated first, but who comes next will be a complex decision based on local epidemiology, societal values, and the ability of the vaccines to prevent both severe disease and to reduce transmission thereby eliciting herd protection. The decision on who to vaccinate should be equitable, highly contextualized, and based on the property of each vaccine. In some settings, the elderly may be prioritized, in others, it may be the population most likely to get infected and responsible for community spread. To support decision-making on who to be prioritized for vaccination requires urgent additional research on the epidemiology of COVID-19; preexisting immunity and who is responsible for transmission in a variety of settings; the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in children and pregnant women; and determining whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission."
Diagnostic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and interpretation of microbiological results.,"Background: To face the current COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic tools are essential. It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (a) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (b) to guide patient care and management and (c) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. Objectives: The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. Sources: A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. Content: The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Implications: Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes."
Persistence and baseline determinants of seropositivity and reinfection rates in health care workers up to 12.5 months after COVID-19.,"We assessed the duration and baseline determinants of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and the occurrence of reinfections in a prospective cohort of 173 Spanish primary health care worker patients followed initially for 9 months and subsequently up to 12.5 months after COVID-19 symptoms onset. Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain antigens up to 149-270 days was 92.49% (90.17% IgG, 76.3% IgA, 60.69% IgM). In a subset of 64 health care workers who had not yet been vaccinated by April 2021, seropositivity was 96.88% (95.31% IgG, 82.81% IgA) up to 322-379 days post symptoms onset. Four suspected reinfections were detected by passive case detection, two among seronegative individuals (5 and 7 months after the first episode), and one low antibody responder. Antibody levels significantly correlated with fever, hospitalization, anosmia/hypogeusia, allergies, smoking, and occupation. Stable sustainment of IgG responses raises hope for long-lasting COVID-19 vaccine immunity."
"COVID-19 pandemic: from origins to outcomes. A comprehensive review of viral pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic."
New Hopes for Drugs against COVID-19 Come from the Sea.,"The latest chapter of the historic battle of humans against pathogenic microbes is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, a respiratory disease declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020 [...]."
Microfluidic devices for detection of RNA viruses.,"There is a long way to go before the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak comes under control. qRT-PCR is currently used for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid-19, but it is expensive, time-consuming, and not as sensitive as it should be. Finding a rapid, easy-to-use, and cheap diagnostic method is necessary to help control the current outbreak. Microfluidic systems provide a platform for many diagnostic tests, including RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, nested-PCR, nucleic acid hybridization, ELISA, fluorescence-Based Assays, rolling circle amplification, aptamers, sample preparation multiplexer (SPM), Porous Silicon Nanowire Forest, silica sol-gel coating/bonding, and CRISPR. They promise faster, cheaper, and easy-to-use methods with higher sensitivity, so microfluidic devices have a high potential to be an alternative method for the detection of viral RNA. These devices have previously been used to detect RNA viruses such as H1N1, Zika, HAV, HIV, and norovirus, with acceptable results. This paper provides an overview of microfluidic systems as diagnostic methods for RNA viruses with a focus on SARS-CoV-2."
Distant residues modulate conformational opening in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) involves the attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike proteins to the ACE2 receptors on the peripheral membrane of host cells. Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and preidentifying them can give clues for designing pan-coronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab initio from our model. Conversely, broad-spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein."
Virolactia in an Asymptomatic Mother with COVID-19.,"Background: Limited data are available on the perinatal and postnatal transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommended breastfeeding with necessary precautions to mothers with COVID-19. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old pregnant woman with no symptoms of COVID-19 presented to the hospital for delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. She was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because her father had been diagnosed with COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the baby and the mother were cared for separately after delivery. Breast milk obtained after first lactation was tested by real-time RT-PCR and was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: In this article, we aimed to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Although further studies are needed, this situation may have an impact on breastfeeding recommendations."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infections in Critical Care Staff: Beware the Risks Beyond the Bedside.,"Objectives: Critical care workers were considered to be at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection from patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom. Subjects: Staff working in critical care. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients. However, staff also need to maintain protective measures away from the bedside."
Comprehensive O-Glycosylation Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Biomimetic Trp-Arg Materials.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health threat. Most vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 target the highly glycosylated spike protein (S). A good knowledge of the glycosylation profile of this protein is key to successful vaccine development. Unlike the 22 confirmed N-glycosylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 S, only a few O-glycosylation sites on this protein have been reported. This difference is mainly ascribed to the extremely low stoichiometry of O-glycosylation. Herein, we designed the biomimetic materials, Trp-Arg (WR) monomer-grafted silica microspheres (designated as WR-SiO2), and these biomimetic materials can enrich N- and O-linked glycopeptides with high selectivity. And WR-SiO2 can resist the nonglycopeptides' interference with the 100 molar fold of BSA during O-linked glycopeptide enrichment. We utilized WR-SiO2 to comprehensively analyze the O-glycosylation profile of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S. Twenty-seven O-glycosylation sites including 18 unambiguous sites are identified on SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study demonstrates that the biomimetic polymer can offer specific selectivity for O-linked glycopeptides and pave the way for O-glycosylation research in biological fields. The O-glycosylation profile of SARS-CoV-2 S might supplement the comprehensive glycosylation in addition to N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S."
COVID-19 in a Patient with Liver Cirrhosis.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a serious issue affecting thousands of people worldwide. It is known that a substantial proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 have abnormal liver function tests; however, the consequences of this information is still not clear. Here we present the first case report of a patient with liver cirrhosis and COVID-19 in our centre. Resolution of COVID-19 symptoms was observed after six days of fever onset. We observed only slight fluctuations of liver enzymes, bilirubin levels and INR without clinical consequences in our case. We suggest testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus on any cirrhotic patient on initial presentation, even without symptoms of COVID-19 in areas where the epidemic was prevalent."
Vaccines After an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA): Modern Evidence Generation Approaches.,"Every medical product requires additional study even after regulatory approval. We highlight several lines of enquiry to advance our understanding of COVID19 vaccines post authorization: identifying key population segments warranting more study, assessment of efficacy, and of safety data, harmonization of data relating to immune response and developing mechanisms for data and knowledge sharing across countries. We show how innovative trial designs and sources from real world data play a critical role in generating evidence."
[Visual analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) studies based on bibliometrics].,"To analyze the development of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), this study systematically retrieved relevant Chinese and English literatures from both CNKI and Web of Science database platforms by bibliometric research method and CiteSpace 5.5.R2 software to obtain information and visualize relevant literatures. A total of 695 Chinese and 446 English literatures were included in this paper. Statistics showed that China had published most of the literatures and established close cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. Through the analysis, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and its affiliated hospitals published the largest number of the publications. Moreover, the highly productive journals including Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine and The Lancet covered eight major fields, such as medicine, medical virology, radiation medicine, infectious disease, and traditional Chinese medicine. Besides, a total of 35 special COVID-19 funds were recently established to subsidize these studies. The key words and themes analysis indicated that protein structure of COVID-19, receptor targets and mechanisms of action, integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, screening and development of antiviral drugs from traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, vaccine research as well as epidemiological characteristics and prediction are current study hotspots. This study provides a reference for researchers to rapidly master main study directions of COVID-19 and screen out relevant literatures."
Nanotheranostics against COVID-19: From multivalent to immune-targeted materials.,"Destructive impacts of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates taking more appropriate measures for mitigating virus spread and development of the effective theranostic agents. In general, high heterogeneity of viruses is a major challenging issue towards the development of effective antiviral agents. Regarding the coronavirus, its high mutation rates can negatively affect virus detection process or the efficiency of drugs and vaccines in development or induce drug resistance. Bioengineered nanomaterials with suitable physicochemical characteristics for site-specific therapeutic delivery, highly-sensitive nanobiosensors for detection of very low virus concentration, and real-time protections using the nanorobots can provide roadmaps towards the imminent breakthroughs in theranostics of a variety of diseases including the COVID-19. Besides revolutionizing the classical disinfection procedures, state-of-the-art nanotechnology-based approaches enable providing the analytical tools for accelerated monitoring of coronavirus and associated biomarkers or drug delivery towards the pulmonary system or other affected organs. Multivalent nanomaterials capable of interaction with multivalent pathogens including the viruses could be suitable candidates for viral detection and prevention of further infections. Besides the inactivation or destruction of the virus, functionalized nanoparticles capable of modulating patient's immune response might be of great significance for attenuating the exaggerated inflammatory reactions or development of the effective nanovaccines and medications against the virus pandemics including the COVID-19."
COVID-19-associated inflammatory syndrome in an adult woman with unexplained multiple organ failure: staying vigilant for COVID-19 complications as the pandemic surges.,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, clinicians have been challenged with a wide spectrum of disease severity. One of the serious complications associated with the virus is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). It is characterised by inflammation leading to organ damage, in the setting of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C is thought to be a postviral reaction where most children are negative on PCR testing but are positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently defined the same phenomenon occurring in adults as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) and emphasised on the use of antibody testing in this population. Here we describe an adult woman with an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 who presented with unexplained organ failure and shock. Positive antibody testing was the only clue to the diagnosis of MIS-A. We stress the importance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in order to identify these cases."
Validation and performance comparison of three SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.,"Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly being used during the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its clinical and epidemiologic utilities are still debatable. Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies."
The Israeli study of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine in pregnancy: considering maternal and neonatal benefits.,"Pregnant patients with COVID-19 are more likely to require intensive care and die compared with noninfected pregnant women. While the consequences of COVID-19 disease in pregnancy prompted many health care organizations to support vaccination in pregnancy, vaccine effects for mother and infant remained unclear. In this issue of the JCI, Beharier and Mayo et al. explored maternal and neonatal responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The authors examined blood samples from women and cord blood of neonates following childbirth. Samples were stratified into three groups: vaccine recipients, unvaccinated participants with past positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and unvaccinated participants without prior infection. Vaccinated mothers and mothers with previous infection generated and transferred protective IgG antibodies across the placenta. This study provides evidence to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy with protection to the neonate against infection, outlining clear vaccine benefits for both maternal and child health."
Improving Hepatitis B Virus Vaccination Responses in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Does Greater Dose and Greater Frequency Lead to Greater Protection?,"Prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) infection is particularly important for patients with inflammatory bowel disease because of risks of HBV reactivation on immunosuppressive therapies. However, immune responses to standard HBV vaccination regimens are suboptimal. Chaparro et al. compared immune responses to 2 vaccines, an adjuvanted HBV vaccine (Fendrix) and double-dosed standard vaccine (Engerix-B) using an accelerated, 4-dose regimen (0, 1, 2, and 6 months). Although the study did not demonstrate superiority of one vaccine over another, several lessons can be derived regarding immune response to vaccinations among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including the need to consider nonstandard regimens for patients on immunosuppression. These lessons can be translated broadly, including to a potential future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine when one becomes available."
The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2.,"Although vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulate the 3D structures and predict the B cell epitopes on the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches and validate epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses."
The role of chemical biology in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.,"Since late 2019, biomedical labs all over the world have been struggling to cope with the 'new normal' and to find ways in which they can contribute to the fight against COVID-19. In this unique situation where a biomedical issue dominates people's lives and the news cycle, chemical biology has a great deal to contribute. This review will describe the importance of science at the chemistry/biology interface to both understand and combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
"Assessing Community Vulnerability over 3 Waves of COVID-19 Pandemic, Hong Kong, China.","We constructed a coronavirus disease community vulnerability index using micro district-level socioeconomic and demographic data and analyzed its correlations with case counts across the 3 pandemic waves in Hong Kong, China. We found that districts with greater vulnerability reported more cases in the third wave when widespread community outbreaks occurred."
Impact of on-site compared to off-site testing for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on duration of isolation and resource utilization.,"Rapid detection and isolation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is the only means of reducing hospital transmission. We describe the impact of implementation of on-site severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on reducing turnaround time, isolation duration, pathology test ordering, and antibiotic use in patients who do not have COVID-19."
In-house reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with increased sensitivity.,"As the COVID-19 infection continues to ravage the world, the advent of an efficient as well as the economization of the existing RT-PCR based detection assay essentially can become a blessing in these testing times and significantly help in the management of the pandemic. This study demonstrated an innovative and rapid corroboration of COVID-19 test based on innovative multiplex PCR. An assessment of optimal PCR conditions to simultaneously amplify the SARS-CoV-2 genes E, S and RdRp has been made by fast-conventional and HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR using the same sets of primers. All variables of practical value were studied by amplifying known target-sequences from ten-fold dilutions of archived positive samples of COVID-19 disease. The multiplexing with newly designed E, S and RdRp primers have shown an efficient amplification of the target region of SARS-CoV-2. A distinct amplification was observed in 37 min using thermal cycler while it took 96 min in HRM coupled real time detection using SYBR green over a wide range of template concentrations. Our findings revealed decent concordance with other commercially available detection kits. This fast HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR with SYBR green approach offers rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cost-effective manner apart from the added advantage of primer compatibility for use in conventional multiplex PCR. The highly reproducible novel approach can propel extended applicability for developing sustainable commercial product besides providing relief to a resource limited setting."
Unilateral Lymphadenopathy After COVID-19 Vaccination: A Practical Management Plan for Radiologists Across Specialties.,"Reports are rising of patients with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, visible on diverse imaging examinations, after recent coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. With less than 10% of the US population fully vaccinated, we can prepare now for informed care of patients imaged after recent vaccination. The authors recommend documenting vaccination information (date[s] of vaccination[s], injection site [left or right, arm or thigh], type of vaccine) on intake forms and having this information available to the radiologist at the time of examination interpretation. These recommendations are based on three key factors: the timing and location of the vaccine injection, clinical context, and imaging findings. The authors report isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (i.e., no imaging findings outside of visible lymphadenopathy), which is ipsilateral to recent (prior 6 weeks) vaccination, as benign with no further imaging indicated. Clinical management is recommended, with ultrasound if clinical concern persists 6 weeks after the final vaccination dose. In the clinical setting to stage a recent cancer diagnosis or assess response to therapy, the authors encourage prompt recommended imaging and vaccination (possibly in the thigh or contralateral arm according to the location of the known cancer). Management in this clinical context of a current cancer diagnosis is tailored to the specific case, ideally with consultation between the oncology treatment team and the radiologist. The aim of these recommendations is to (1) reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs of unnecessary evaluation of enlarged nodes in the setting of recent vaccination and (2) avoid further delays in vaccinations and recommended imaging for best patient care during the pandemic."
COVID-19 in an HIV-positive kidney transplant recipient.,We report a case of a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and kidney transplant who presented with SARS-CoV-2. We also present a review of COVID-19 cases in kidney transplant recipients.
Management of anaphylaxis due to COVID-19 vaccines in the elderly.,"Older adults, especially men and/or those with diabetes, hypertension, and/or obesity, are prone to severe COVID-19. In some countries, older adults, particularly those residing in nursing homes, have been prioritized to receive COVID-19 vaccines due to high risk of death. In very rare instances, the COVID-19 vaccines can induce anaphylaxis, and the management of anaphylaxis in older people should be considered carefully. An ARIA-EAACI-EuGMS (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and European Geriatric Medicine Society) Working Group has proposed some recommendations for older adults receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccines is extremely rare (from 1 per 100,000 to 5 per million injections). Symptoms are similar in younger and older adults but they tend to be more severe in the older patients. Adrenaline is the mainstay treatment and should be readily available. A flowchart is proposed to manage anaphylaxis in the older patients."
The challenges of COVID-19 testing in Africa: the Ethiopian experience.,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly and creating a huge economic, social and public health challenge worldwide. Although currently an effective vaccine is ready, its distribution is limited, and hence the only currently available lever to reduce transmission is to identify and isolate individuals who are contagious. Thus, testing for SARS CoV-2 has a paramount importance. However, testing in many African countries including Ethiopia has multidimensional growing challenges. Here, we tried to identify, categorize and summarize the challenges of COVID-19 testing in Africa from Ethiopian experience."
The real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction threshold cycle values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 predict the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies from mild to critical. We retrospectively examined whether clinical and laboratory findings on admission could predict COVID-19 prognosis. Among various factors associated with COVID-19 severity, our results indicated that the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) threshold cycle (Ct) values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were the most useful predictor of COVID-19 prognosis."
"The experiences of nurses infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A qualitative study.","Aim: To understand about the experiences and feelings of the nurses infected with COVID-19 when caring for patients with COVID-19. Background: With the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nurses take care of patients with COVID-19 and have a very high risk of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) themselves. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative design of hermeneutic phenomenology. A purposeful sampling was used, and all data were collected through in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews then analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: The interview data generated 4 topics and 14 secondary topics. Four major themes were identified from this study, including 'experiences of infection', 'health belief', 'social support' and 'the pursuit of self-worth'. Conclusions: Nurses infected by COVID-19 experienced a physical and psychological shock. They had a strong sense of responsibility and willingness to take risks. Providing professional psychological counselling and physical rehabilitation services are crucial. Implications for nursing management: This manuscript provides nursing managers an understanding of the personal experiences and needs of clinical nurses in their work, especially during COVID-19. It is helpful for nursing managers to explore the greater driving force of nurses and prepare nursing human resources for greater challenges."
Are Individuals with Substance Use Disorders at Higher Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection? Population-Based Registry Study in Northern Italy.,"Background and aim: This study assesses whether individuals with substance use disorder are at greater risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than people in the general population. Methods: A population-based study was conducted including 3,780 individuals, diagnosed with alcohol or other drug dependence and cared for by the addiction service (AS) in the province of Reggio Emilia. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and relative 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of being tested and of being SARS-CoV-2 positive in the population of interest compared with those in the general population of Reggio Emilia were calculated. Results: Both individuals with alcohol and those with other drug use disorders had a lower risk of being SARS-CoV-2 positive (SIR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.32-1.30, SIR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.24-1.10, respectively), despite higher rates of being tested than the general population (SIR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.14-1.89, SIR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.20-1.86, respectively). Among HIV-negative persons, 12.5% were positive to SARS-CoV-2, while none was positive among HIV-positive persons. HCV-infected AS clients had a higher risk of both being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (SIR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.26-2.98) and of resulting positive (SIR = 1.53; 95% CI 0.50-3.58). Conclusions: Individuals with alcohol and/or other drug use disorders are at higher risk of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection but at lower risk of resulting positive than the general population. Further research is warranted in order to support our findings and to address plausible factors underpinning such associations."
SARS-CoV-2 Positivity on or After 9 Days Among Quarantined Student Contacts of Confirmed Cases.,"This study describes coronavirus test positivity rates among elementary, middle, and high school student contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a Florida county where schools required a negative test on day 9 before return to school on day 10."
"Intrafamilial Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Associated with Cellular Immune Response without Seroconversion, France.","We investigated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and OC43 in 11 SARS-CoV-2 serodiscordant couples in Strausbourg, France, in which 1 partner had evidence of mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and in 10 unexposed healthy controls. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were considered index patients and their partners close contacts. All index patients displayed positive SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T-cell responses that lasted up to 102 days after symptom onset. All contacts remained seronegative for SARS-CoV-2; however, 6 reported COVID-19 symptoms within a median of 7 days after their partners, and 4 of those showed a positive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response against 3 or 4 SARS-CoV-2 antigens that lasted up to 93 days after symptom onset. The 11 couples and controls displayed positive T-cell responses against HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43. These data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can induce virus-specific T-cell responses without seroconversion."
Derivation and Internal Validation of a Model to Predict the Probability of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infection in Community People.,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 disease. There are concerns regarding limited testing capacity and the exclusion of cases from unproven screening criteria. Knowing COVID-19 risks can inform testing. This study derived and assessed a model to predict risk of SARS-CoV-2 in community-based people. Methods: All people presenting to a community-based COVID-19 screening center answered questions regarding symptoms, possible exposure, travel, and occupation. These data were anonymously linked to SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Logistic regression was used to derive a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bootstrap sampling evaluated the model. Results: A total of 9172 consecutive people were studied. Overall infection rate was 6.2% but this varied during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 infection likelihood was primarily influenced by contact with a COVID-19 case, fever symptoms, and recent case detection rates. Internal validation found that the SARS-CoV-2 Risk Prediction Score (SCRiPS) performed well with good discrimination (c-statistic 0.736, 95%CI 0.715-0.757) and very good calibration (integrated calibration index 0.0083, 95%CI 0.0048-0.0131). Focusing testing on people whose expected SARS-CoV-2 risk equaled or exceeded the recent case detection rate would increase the number of identified SARS-CoV-2 cases by 63.1% (95%CI 54.5-72.3). Conclusion: The SCRiPS model accurately estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based people undergoing testing. Using SCRiPS can importantly increase SARS-CoV-2 infection identification when testing capacity is limited."
"Prolonged persistence of PCR-detectable virus during an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit in King County, Washington.","Background: We describe key characteristics, interventions, and outcomes of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak within an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit at the University of Washington Medical Center - Northwest. Methods: After identifying 2 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 11, 2020, we conducted an outbreak investigation and employed targeted interventions including: screening of patients and staff; isolation and cohorting of confirmed cases; serial testing; and enhanced infection prevention measures. Results: We identified 10 patients and 7 staff members with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty percent of patients (n = 3) remained asymptomatic over the course of infection. Among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, fever (n = 5, 50%) and cough (n = 4, 40%) were the most common symptoms. Median duration of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity was 25.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 22.8-41.8) among symptomatic patients and 22.0 days (IQR 19.5-25.5) among asymptomatic patients. Median initial (19.0, IQR 18.7-25.7 vs 21.7, IQR 20.7-25.6) and nadir (18.9, IQR 18.2-20.3 vs 19.8, IQR 17.0-20.7) cycle threshold values were similar across symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusions: Asymptomatic infection was common in this cohort of hospitalized, elderly individuals despite similar duration of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and cycle threshold values among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients."
Non-human primate models of human respiratory infections.,"Respiratory pathogens represent a great burden for humanity and a potential source of new pandemics, as illustrated by the recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In recent decades, biotechnological advances have led to the development of numerous innovative therapeutic molecules and vaccine immunogens. However, we still lack effective treatments and vaccines against many respiratory pathogens. More than ever, there is a need for a fast, predictive, preclinical pipeline, to keep pace with emerging diseases. Animal models are key for the preclinical development of disease management strategies. The predictive value of these models depends on their ability to reproduce the features of the human disease, the mode of transmission of the infectious agent and the availability of technologies for monitoring infection. This review focuses on the use of non-human primates as relevant preclinical models for the development of prevention and treatment for human respiratory infections."
Immunoinformatic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein and Identification of COVID-19 Vaccine Targets.,"COVID-19 is a worldwide emergency; therefore, there is a critical need for foundational knowledge about B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 essential for vaccine development. However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease. Finally, these predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this high priority virus."
CT imaging of the COVID-19.,"COVID-19 pneumonia presented with certain characteristic chest CT imaging features, which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this emerging global health emergency. In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19. Except for one case with normal lung appearance, all the other four cases had certain characteristics, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and atoll sign. The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral portion of lung."
"Mental disorders, psychopharmacological treatments, and mortality in 2150 COVID-19 Spanish inpatients.","Objective: To determine how mental disorders and psychopharmacological treatments before and during COVID-19 hospital admissions are related to mortality. Methods: Subjects included in the study were all adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed clinically and by PCR, who were admitted to a tertiary university hospital in Badalona (Spain) between March 1 and November 17, 2020. Data were extracted anonymously from computerized clinical records. Results: 2,150 subjects were included, 57% males, mean age 61 years. History of mental disorders was registered in 957 (45%). Throughout admission, de novo diagnosis of mood or anxiety, stress, or adjustment disorder was made in 12% of patients without previous history. Delirium was diagnosed in 10% of cases. 1011 patients (47%) received a psychotropic prescription during admission (36% benzodiazepines, 22% antidepressants, and 21% antipsychotics). Mortality rate was 17%. Delirium during admission and history of mood disorder were independently associated with higher mortality risk (hazard ratios, 1.39 and 1.52 respectively), while previous year's treatments with anxiolytics/hypnotics and antidepressants were independently associated with lower mortality risk (hazard ratios, 0.47 and 0.43, respectively). Conclusion: Mental symptoms are very common in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Detecting, diagnosing, and treating them is key to determining the prognosis of the disease and functional recovery."
Typical symptoms of common otorhinolaryngological diseases may mask a SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates predominantly in the upper respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets and aerosols. Taking the medical history for typical COVID-19 symptoms and PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing have become established as screening procedures. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical appearance of SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive patients and to determine the SARS-CoV-2 contact risk for health care workers (HCW). Methods: The retrospective study included n = 2283 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from n = 1725 patients with otorhinolaryngological (ORL) diseases performed from March to November 2020 prior to inpatient treatment. In addition, demographic data and medical history were assessed. Results: n = 13 PCR tests (0.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rate showed a significant increase during the observation period (p < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical symptoms that led to a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 before PCR testing. The patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had symptoms that were interpreted as symptoms typical of the ORL disease or secondary diagnoses (n = 9). Conclusion: The identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is a considerable challenge in clinical practice. Our findings illustrate that taking a medical history alone is of limited value and cannot replace molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for patients with ORL diseases. Our data also demonstrate that there is a high probability of contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in everyday clinical practice, so that the use of personal protective equipment, even in apparently ""routine cases"", is highly recommended."
Prioritizing COVID-19 tests based on participatory surveillance and spatial scanning.,"Objectives: This study aimed to identify, describe and analyze priority areas for COVID-19 testing combining participatory surveillance and traditional surveillance. Design: It was carried out a descriptive transversal study in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, Brazil, within the period of 20/02/2020 to 05/05/2020. Data included all official reports for influenza-like illness notified by the municipality health department and the self-reports collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona. Methods: We used linear regression and loess regression to verify a correlation between Participatory Surveillance (PS) and Traditional Surveillance (TS). Also a spatial scanning approach was deployed in order to identify risk clusters for COVID-19. Results: In Caruaru, the PS had 861 active users, presenting an average of 1.2 reports per user per week. The platform Brasil Sem Corona started on March 20th and since then, has been officially used by the Caruaru health authority to improve the quality of information from the traditional surveillance system. Regarding the respiratory syndrome cases from TS, 1588 individuals were positive for this clinical outcome. The spatial scanning analysis detected 18 clusters and 6 of them presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.1). Clusters 3 and 4 presented an overlapping area that was chosen by the local authority to deploy the COVID-19 serology, where 50 individuals were tested. From there, 32 % (n = 16) presented reagent results for antibodies related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Participatory surveillance is an effective epidemiological method to complement the traditional surveillance system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by adding real-time spatial data to detect priority areas for COVID-19 testing."
Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage development across the first and second waves in Eastern Germany in 2020: insights into the cause of the second wave.,"In Germany, Eastern regions had a mild first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from March to May 2020, but were badly hit by a second wave later in autumn and winter. It is unknown how the second wave was initiated and developed in Eastern Germany where the number of COVID-19 cases was close to zero in June and July 2020. We used genomic epidemiology to investigate the dynamic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage development across the first and second waves in Eastern Germany. With detailed phylogenetic analyses we could show that SARS-CoV-2 lineages prevalent in the first and second waves in Eastern Germany were different, with several new variants including four predominant lineages in the second wave, having been introduced into Eastern Germany between August and October 2020. The results indicate that the major driving force behind the second wave was the introduction of new variants."
Correlation of Population SARS-CoV-2 Cycle Threshold Values to Local Disease Dynamics: Exploratory Observational Study.,"Background: Despite the limitations in the use of cycle threshold (CT) values for individual patient care, population distributions of CT values may be useful indicators of local outbreaks. Objective: We aimed to conduct an exploratory analysis of potential correlations between the population distribution of cycle threshold (CT) values and COVID-19 dynamics, which were operationalized as percent positivity, transmission rate (Rt), and COVID-19 hospitalization count. Methods: In total, 148,410 specimens collected between September 15, 2020, and January 11, 2021, from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. The daily median CT value, daily Rt, daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression were used to evaluate possible associations between daily median CT values and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots were used to determine whether a time delay existed between changes in daily median CT values and measures of community disease dynamics. Results: Daily median CT values negatively correlated with the daily Rt values (P<.001), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization counts (with a 33-day time delay; P<.001), and the daily changes in percent positivity among testing samples (P<.001). Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT values and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT values and COVID-19 hospitalization counts (P<.001). Conclusions: This study adds to the literature by analyzing samples collected from an entire geographical area and contextualizing the results with other research investigating population CT values."
Sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and clinical trials in Uganda: a cross-sectional study in western Uganda.,"Background: Health experts agree that widespread use of safe and effective vaccines will rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The big question is whether these vaccines can easily be accepted by their end-users. Our study aimed at determining sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of vaccines and clinical trials of COVID-19 in western Uganda. Method: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception were assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval in R software version 3.6.3. Results: There were 1067 participants in the study. The majority were males (73.2%) and age group 31-40 years (32.6%). The acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination was (53.6%; 572/1067) with those aged 18-20 years, males, elites at tertiary level of education (degree or diploma), students, Muslims, married, non-salary earners and rural dwellers having better odds and likeliness to accept vaccination. Only 44.6% (476/1067) showed interest in clinical trials among which; males, primary school leavers, students, Christians, un-married, respondents who didn't earn any salary and rural dwellers had better odds and likelihood to participate in clinical trials. Conclusion: There was a low level of vaccine acceptance and clinical trial interest in western Uganda. Minority groups in the study i.e., Muslims, students, primary school leavers, un-married rural dwellers among others showed more interest in vaccination and clinical trials. We anticipated fears in the larger part of this community that health experts need to address through reassurance of the community that vaccines are tested and that they are safe and important if we are to rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic."
HLA-dependent heterogeneity and macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease.,"Background: The worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by significant and unpredictable heterogeneity in symptoms that remains poorly understood. Methods: Transcriptome and single cell transcriptome of COVID19 lung were integrated with deeplearning analysis of MHC class I immunopeptidome against SARS-COV2 proteome. Results: An analysis of the transcriptomes of lung samples from COVID-19 patients revealed that activation of MHC class I antigen presentation in these tissues was correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA present. Similarly, a positive relationship was detected in these samples between the level of SARS-CoV-2 and the expression of a genomic cluster located in the 6p21.32 region (40 kb long, inside the MHC-II cluster) that encodes constituents of the immunoproteasome. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of bronchoalveolar cells highlighted the activation of the immunoproteasome in CD68 + M1 macrophages of COVID-19 patients in addition to a PSMB8-based trajectory in these cells that featured an activation of defense response during mild cases of the disease, and an impairment of alveolar clearance mechanisms during severe COVID-19. By examining the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome with the most common HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles worldwide, we found higher numbers of stronger presenters in type A alleles and in Asian populations, which could shed light on why this disease is now less widespread in this part of the world. Conclusions: HLA-dependent heterogeneity in macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease could have implications for efforts to predict the response to HLA-dependent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the global population."
MUC1-C influences cell survival in lung adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in lung cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of mucin 1 (MUC1) after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung epithelial cancer cell line Calu-3. MUC1 is a major constituent of the mucus layer in the respiratory tract and contributes to pathogen defense. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) expression in a STAT3 activation-dependent manner. Inhibition of MUC1-C signaling increased apoptosis-related protein levels and reduced proliferation-related protein levels; however, SARS-CoV-2 replication was not affected. Together, these results suggest that increased MUC1-C expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger the growth of lung cancer cells, and COVID-19 may be a risk factor for lung cancer patients.

"Evolution of SARS-CoV-2: Review of Mutations, Role of the Host Immune System.","Since the reporting of the first cases of coronavirus in China and the publication of the first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the virus has undergone numerous mutations. In Europe, the spring outbreak (March-April) was followed by a drop in the number of cases and deaths. The disease may have evolved into a milder form. The increase in PCR-positive cases in late summer 2020 did not lead to the expected increase in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths, based on the severity of the disease in the spring. This difference in disease severity could be due to factors independent of the virus or to the evolution of the virus. This review attempts to identify the mutations that have appeared since the beginning of the pandemic and their role in the temporal evolution of the pandemic. There are a cell and humoral type cross-reactivity in a large part of the population to common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2. Evolutionarily important mutations and deletions have emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding proteins that interact with the host immune system. In addition, one of the major mutations (in viral polymerase) is logically associated with a higher frequency of mutations throughout the genome. This frequency fluctuates over time and shows a peak at the time when the epidemic was most active. The rate of mutations in proteins involved in the relationship to the immune system continues to increase after the first outbreak. The cross-reactivity on the 1 hand and the viral mutations observed on the other hand could explain the evolution of the pandemic until the summer of 2020, partly due to the evolution of the virus in relation to the host immune system. The immunization campaign began in December 2020: concerns are emerging about a possible escape of the circulating variants vaccines in early 2021. These variants could also escape immunity acquired through infection with the 2020 strains."
LAMP Diagnostics at the Point-of-Care: Emerging Trends and Perspectives for the Developer Community.,"Introduction: Over the past decade, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology has played an important role in molecular diagnostics. Amongst numerous nucleic acid amplification assays, LAMP stands out in terms of sample-to-answer time, sensitivity, specificity, cost, robustness, and accessibility, making it ideal for field-deployable diagnostics in resource-limited regions.Areas covered: In this review, we outline the front-end LAMP design practices for point-of-care (POC) applications, including sample handling and various signal readout methodologies. Next, we explore existing LAMP technologies that have been validated with clinical samples in the field. We summarize recent work that utilizes reverse transcription (RT) LAMP to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative to standard PCR protocols. Finally, we describe challenges in translating LAMP from the benchtop to the field and opportunities for future LAMP assay development and performance reporting.Expert opinion: Despite the popularity of LAMP in the academic research community and a recent surge in interest in LAMP due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are numerous areas for improvement in the fundamental understanding of LAMP, which are needed to elevate the field of LAMP assay development and characterization."
SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 Has about Twofold Replicative Advantage and Acquires Concerning Mutations.,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7), first collected in United Kingdom on 20 September 2020, is a rapidly growing lineage that in January 2021 constituted 86% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England. The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary). These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence."
Current emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Potential direct/indirect negative impacts of virus persistence and related therapeutic drugs on the aquatic compartments.,"The purpose of the present work is to provide a complete overview of possible direct/indirect implications on the quality of aquatic compartments due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. With this aim, the environmental impacts are mainly related to i) the virus persistence in sewage and wastewaters, and ii) possible fate in aquatic compartments of drugs tested and administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 spread is very recent, and there is a lack of specific studies on this strain, the virus persistence in wastewaters, the parameters influencing the persistence, as well as the detection methodologies are referenced to the general coronaviruses group. However, the present detailed report of up-to-date knowledge on this topic can provide a useful source for further studies focusing on more deepened investigations of SARS-CoV-2 behaviour in the environment. Such a perspective is significant not only for the control of virus diffusion but also represents a crucial point for the identification of produced alteration to the environmental quality."
Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 - a systematic review.,"Introduction: Following two coronaviral epidemics in 2002 and 2012, December 2019 saw the emergence of a potentially fatal coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China. While most coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infections, they have been demonstrated to be neuroinvasive and neurotropic for over three decades. In this review, we assess whether SARS-CoV-2 follows this trend and if the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus is worthy of further investigation. Methods: To obtain sources for this study, we performed an online search through Pubmed, Researchgate and Google Scholar, finding 537 articles. After analysing them according to PRISMA, we included 14 in this review. Discussion: Data regarding neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce and mostly inconsistent. There are however identifiable trends which might provide a basis for future research. There is strong evidence that this novel coronavirus may be neuroinvasive and could cause a wide array of neurological symptoms and complications. Cerebrospinal fluid testing may shed more light on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system. Clarification of the respiratory failure mechanisms requires post mortem examinations and brain tissue analysis, and further research is of the utmost importance. However, we strongly believe that the existing evidence is enough to raise awareness among clinicians and help guide them through the diagnosis and optimal therapy of COVID-19 patients."
Case Series of Headache Characteristics in COVID-19: Headache Can Be an Isolated Symptom.,"Headache was reported in up to one-third of the hospitalized patients; yet, the clinical characteristics of headache associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been defined. This observational case study included patients who were consulted to headache unit due to headache and had COVID-19 illness. Headache features in 13 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were reported. Headache was the isolated symptom of the COVID-19 in 3 patients and emerged as an early symptom during the disease course in all patients. Patients specified severe, rapid onset, unrelenting headache with migraine-like features, as well as unusual sensory symptoms such as anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and loss of appetite and weight. Headache lasted up to 3 days in 70% of the patients and resolved in all patients within 2 weeks. Despite the fact that most of the patients were female and headache characteristics were suggestive of migraine, majority of patients were not suffering from primary headaches. It was concluded that headache could be an isolated symptom of COVID-19, which might possibly be ignored in asymptomatic patients. Headaches associated with COVID-19 included features resembling migraine and/or atypical symptoms including anosmia and diarrhea."
Unsupervised cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reflects its geographic progression and identifies distinct genetic subgroups of SARS-CoV-2 virus.,"Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2virus have been made readily available during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the initial genome sequence of the virus was released on the open access Virological website (http://virological.org/) early on January 11. We utilize the published data on the single stranded RNAs of 11,132 SARS-CoV-2 patients in the GISAID database, which contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Among many important research questions which are currently being investigated, one aspect pertains to the genetic characterization/classification of the virus. We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modeling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, and so forth, we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index. Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. This is in line with a phylogenetic analysis which we use to contrast our results. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups. It is the subject of ongoing research to examine whether the genetic subgroup could be related to diseases outcome and its potential implications for vaccine development."
Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees-An efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons?,"Background: Different levels of control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. Methods and findings: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world-and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. Conclusions: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully."
SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Exhaled by Experimentally Infected Cynomolgus Monkeys.,"We analyzed size of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) aerosol particles shed by experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys. Most exhaled particles were small, and virus was mainly released early during infection. By postinfection day 6, no virus was detected in breath, but air in the isolator contained large quantities of aerosolized virus."
"Interim Estimates of COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against COVID-19-Associated Emergency Department or Urgent Care Clinic Encounters and Hospitalizations Among Adults During SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant Predominance - Nine States, June-August 2021.","Data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) since the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States are limited (1-3). CDC used the VISION Network* to examine medical encounters (32,867) from 187 hospitals and 221 emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care (UC) clinics across nine states during June-August 2021, beginning on the date the Delta variant accounted for >50% of sequenced isolates in each medical facility's state. VISION Network methods have been published (4)."
Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with immune reconstitution therapies.,"Background: It has been generally accepted that people with MS (PwMS) should be vaccinated against COVID-19. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the humoral response to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and to two COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech and Beijing/Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) in our cohort of PwMS under high efficacy disease modifying therapies (DMTs), cladribine and alemtuzumab. Methods: Twenty two PwMS treated at the Clinic of Neurology, in Belgrade, who developed COVID-19 and/or were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, during treatment with cladribine and alemtuzumab, were included. Out of 18 patients treated with cladribine, 11 developed COVID-19, and 11 were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (four with mRNA vaccine, 7 with Sinopharm). Four MS patients under alemtuzumab were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; three with mRNA, and one with Sinopharm vaccine. SARS-Cov-2 IgG response was measured using ELISA anti-spike protein-based serology (INEP, Belgrade, Serbia). Results: All 7 patients under cladribine treatment who suffered from COVID-19, developed IgG antibodies, 2.0-5.5 months after last symptoms. All four (100%) patients under cladribine who were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and three out of seven (42.9%) vaccinated with Sinopharm, developed antibodies. All 4 patients under alemtuzumab developed antibodies after vaccination. In all cases, seroprotection occurred, irrespective of timing of vaccination and absolute lymphocyte count. Conclusion: Our findings in a small number of highly active PwMS in whom, lymphodepleting, immune reconstitution therapies, were applied in order to successfully manage MS, indicate that in a number of these patients it was possible to develop at the same time seroprotection in these patients after COVID-19 vaccination in these complex circumstances."
Digital Health Technologies Respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic In a Tertiary Hospital in China: Development and Usability Study.,"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a continuing global pandemic. Hospitals are integral to the control and prevention of COVID-19; however, they are facing numerous challenges during the epidemic. Objective: Our study aimed to introduce the practical experience of the design and implementation of a web-based COVID-19 service platform at a tertiary hospital in China as well as the preliminary results of the implementation. Methods: The web-based COVID-19 service platform was deployed within the health care system of the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital and Internet Hospital; the function of the platform was to provide web-based medical services for both members of the public and lay health care workers. The focal functions of this system included automated COVID-19 screening, related symptom monitoring, web-based consultation, and psychological support; it also served as a COVID-19 knowledge hub. The design and process of each function are introduced. The usage data for the platform service were collected and are represented by three periods: the pre-epidemic period (December 22, 2019, to January 22, 2020, 32 days), the controlled period (January 23 to March 31, 2020, 69 days), and the postepidemic period (April 1 to June 30, 2020, 91 days). Results: By the end of June 2020, 96,642 people had used the automated COVID-19 screening and symptom monitoring systems 161,884 and 7,795,194 times, respectively. The number of general web-based consultation services per day increased from 30 visits in the pre-epidemic period to 122 visits during the controlled period, then dropped to 73 visits in the postepidemic period. The psychological counseling program served 636 clients during the epidemic period. For people who used the automated COVID-19 screening service, 160,916 (99.40%) of the total users were classified in the no risk category. 464 (0.29%) of the people were categorized as medium to high risk, and 12 people (0.01%) were recommended for further COVID-19 testing and treatment. Among the 96,642 individuals who used the COVID-19 related symptoms monitoring service, 6696 (6.93%) were symptomatic at some point during the monitoring period. Fever was the most frequently reported symptom, with 2684/6696 symptomatic people (40.1%) having had this symptom. Cough and sore throat were also relatively frequently reported by the 6696 symptomatic users (1657 people, 24.7%, and 1622 people, 24.2%, respectively). Conclusions: The web-based COVID-19 service platform implemented at a tertiary hospital in China is exhibited to be a role model for using digital health technologies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital solutions of automated COVID-19 screening, daily symptom monitoring, web-based care, and knowledge propagation have plausible acceptability and feasibility for complementing offline hospital services and facilitating disease control and prevention."
A Case Study: Analysis of Patents on Coronaviruses and Covid-19 for Technological Assessment and Future Research.,"Background: Protecting intellectual property rights are important and particularly pertinent for inventions that are an outcome of rigorous research and development. While the grant of patents is subject to establishing novelty and inventive step, it further indicates the technological development and is helpful for researchers working in the same technical domain. The aim of the present research work is to map the existing work through an analysis of patent literature in the field of Coronaviruses (CoV), particularly COVID-19 (2019-nCoV). CoV is a large family of viruses known to cause illness in humans and animals, particularly known for causing respiratory infections, as evidenced in earlier times, such as in MERS i.e., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; and SRS i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently identified novel-coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has caused pandemic situations across the globe. Objective: To expand the analysis of patents related to CoV and 2019-nCoV, an evaluation has been conducted by patenting trends of particular strains of identified CoV diseases by present legal status, main concerned countries via the earliest priority years and its assignee types and inventors of identified relevant patents. The global patent documents were analyzed to check the scope of claims along with focuses and trends of the published patent documents for the entire CoV family, including 2019-nCoV through the present landscape. Methods: To extract the results, the Derwent Innovation database was used by a combination of different keystrings. Approximately 3800 patents were obtained and further scrutinized and analyzed. The present write-up also discusses the recent progress of patent applications in a period of the year 2010 to 2020 (present) along with the recent developments in India for the treatment options for CoV and 2019-nCoV. Results: Present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. Conclusion: The present paper analyzes the existing patents in the field of Coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV and suggests a way forward for the effective contribution in this upcoming research area. From the trend analysis, an increase in the filing of the overall trend of patent families was observed for a period of 2010 to the current year. This multifaceted analysis of identified patent literature provides an understanding of the focuses on present ongoing research and a grey area in terms of the trends of technological innovations in disease management in patients with CoV and 2019-nCoV. Furthermore, the findings and outcome of the present study offer insights for the proposed research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information in order to facilitate policymakers, academia, research-driven institutes and also investors to make better decisions regarding programmed steps for research and development for the diagnosis, treatment and taking preventive measures for CoV and 2019-nCoV. The present article also emphasizes the need for future development and the role of academia and collaboration with industry for speedy research with a rationale."
Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and vaccination in Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers.,"Background/objectives: COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality in nursing homes. Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. Setting: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. Intervention: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. Results: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. Conclusion: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents."
"Potential Presymptomatic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Zhejiang Province, China, 2020.","We report a 2-family cluster of persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, during January 2020. The infections resulted from contact with an infected but potentially presymptomatic traveler from the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province."
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination intentions among mothers of children aged 9 to 12 years: a survey of the All Our Families cohort.,"Background: Acceptance of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to achieving high levels of immunization. The objectives of this study were to understand mothers' SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers' intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. Results: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. Interpretation: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake."
The Use of Cyclodextrin or its Complexes as a Potential Treatment Against the 2019 Novel Coronavirus: A Mini-Review.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has spread rapidly since its discovery in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Hubei, reaching this day all the continents. This scourge is, unfortunately, in lineage with various dangerous outbreaks such as Ebola, Cholera, Spanish flu, American seasonal flu. Until today, the best solution for the moment remains prevention (Social distancing, hand disinfection, use of masks, partial or total sanitary containment, etc.); there is also the emergence of drug treatment (research and development, clinical trials, use on patients). Recent reviews emphasized the role of membrane lipids in the infectivity mechanism of SARS-COV-2. Cholesterol-rich parts of cell membranes serve as docking places of host cells for the viruses. Coronavirus 2 is a member of a virus family with lipid envelope that fuses with host cell through endocytosis, internalizing its components in the cell. In vitro cell models have shown that depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin, and particularly methyl beta cyclodextrin disturb the host cell membrane lipid composition this way, reducing the attachment of the virus to the protein receptors. This review aims to summarize the state of the art of research concerning the use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against this new virus and update work already published."
Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2/COVID19.,"Purpose of review: SARS-CoV-2 is the novel human coronavirus responsible for the COVID19 pandemic. Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included. Recent findings: RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves. Summary: A variety of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have recently been developed and deployed. Clinicians should understand the appropriate use and interpretation of RNA PCR, antigen testing and immune assays for SARS-CoV-2 in order to diagnose and treat patients in this evolving pandemic."
DNA-launched RNA replicon vaccines induce potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in mice.,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its rapid spread into a global pandemic made the urgent development of scalable vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global health and economic imperative. Here, we characterized and compared the immunogenicity of two alphavirus-based DNA-launched self-replicating (DREP) vaccine candidates encoding either SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (DREP-S) or a spike ectodomain trimer stabilized in prefusion conformation (DREP-Secto). We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization. These data provide important novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design using a rapid response DNA vaccine platform. Moreover, they encourage the use of mixed vaccine modalities as a strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2."
Duodenal perforation in a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with negative PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal fluid.,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected health care organizations globally. Many aspects of this disease, as well as the risks for patients treated with multiple drug regimens to control severe COVID-19, are unclear. During emergency surgery for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission to the surgical staff has yet to be determined. Patients and methods: In this report, we describe a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with severe respiratory syndrome treated with multiple doses of IL-6 inhibitors who presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer and underwent emergency surgery. During and after surgery, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the ulcer site and in the peritoneal fluid. Results: The history of the patient allows for two possible interpretations of the pathogenesis of the duodenal ulcer, which could have been a stress ulcer, or a gastrointestinal ulcer associated to the use of IL-6 inhibitors. We also noticed that the ulcer site and peritoneal fluid repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the pertinent literature on gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 and on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the peritoneal fluid of surgical patients and discussed possible prevention strategies for bleeding and the actual risk of infection for the surgical staff. Conclusions: The first implication of this case is that the relation between repeated administration of IL-6 inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation must be investigated, and that the threshold for administering prophylactic proton pump inhibitors therapy should be carefully considered for patients with severe COVID-19. The second implication is that further testing should be performed on the peritoneal fluid of COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures to clarify the discordant results for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal cavity and the possible risk of transmission to the surgical staff."
Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intraocular milieu.,"The purpose of this research is to study the intraocular occurrence of SARS-CoV-2. In postmortem examinations, aqueous humor and the vitreous samples were collected. All individuals were previously positive in nasopharyngeal swabbing and cause of death was respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Testing was done using quantitative RT-PCR. We included 16 aqueous humor and 16 vitreous samples for PCR testing. None of the results was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Human GAPDH genes to verify the presence of RNA was present in all aqueous humor samples (16/16, 100%) and 15/16 (93.8%) vitreous samples. In conclusion, this case series found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intraocular milieu."
The COVID-19-Cancer Connection.,"I recently completed work at a large-scale, drive-through COVID-19 vaccination initiative and was immediately struck by its military parallel in mobilizing this emergent medical response. Federal personnel were deployed quickly to assist the local workforce untested in a public health domain. The expansive integration of technology was at a level I had not previously witnessed. Computerized algorithms organized the flow of cars through a huge fairground (think Disneyland Park). Databases were created to register the public, make appointments, and document the specifics of vaccination administration. From day one, the pharmacy tent was in constant overdrive to ensure vaccine supply was in sync with hourly demand. The interface of all these platforms vaccinated 2,300 people per day."
Navigating inequities: a roadmap out of the pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed social inequities that rival biological inequities in disease exposure and severity. Merely identifying some inequities without understanding all of them can lead to harmful misrepresentations and deepening disparities. Applying an 'equity lens' to bring inequities into focus without a vision to extinguish them is short-sighted. Interventions to address inequities should be as diverse as the pluralistic populations experiencing them. We present the first validated equity framework applied to COVID-19 that sheds light on the full spectrum of health inequities, navigates their sources and intersections, and directs ethically just interventions. The Equity Matrix also provides a comprehensive map to guide surveillance and research in order to unveil epidemiological uncertainties of novel diseases like COVID-19, recognising that inequities may exist where evidence is currently insufficient. Successfully applied to vaccines in recent years, this tool has resulted in the development of clear, timely and transparent guidance with positive stakeholder feedback on its comprehensiveness, relevance and appropriateness. Informed by evidence and experience from other vaccine-preventable diseases, this Equity Matrix could be valuable to countries across the social gradient to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by abating the spread of inequities. In the race to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this urgently needed roadmap can effectively and efficiently steer global leadership towards equitable allocation with diverse strategies for diverse inequities. Such a roadmap has been absent from discussions on managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and is critical for our passage out of it."
"Poor sensitivity of ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, South Korea)"".","Background: Several molecular kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mostly lacking of proper clinical evaluation due to the emergency caused by COVID19 pandemia, particularly at developing countries like Ecuador. Objective: We carried out an evaluation of the clinical performance of ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" (Bioneer, South Korea) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA) as a gold standard. Results: 48 clinical specimens were included on the study, 38 tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 10 SARS-CoV-2 negative for 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit. For ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"", only 30 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, indicating a low clinical performance with sensitivity of 78.9%. Moreover, the limit of detection for ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" was estimated to be higher than 40,000 viral RNA copies/mL of sample. Conclusions: Proper clinical performance evaluation studies from government agencies at developing countries should be mandatory prior to clinical use authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis kits, particularly when those kits lack of either FDA or its country of origin clinical use authorization, to prevent the distribution of low quality products that may have a negative impact of COVID19 surveillance at developing countries."
[Three cases of COVID-19 in elderly patients with delayed release from isolation due to persistent positive polymerase chain reaction findings].,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide, with no sign of its control in Japan yet. Eight elderly COVID-19 patients over 90 years of age were treated at our hospital. We herein report three cases with characteristic progression. Case 1 was a 91-year-old female patient diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia previously who did not show improvement with medication; thus, she was transferred to our hospital 16 days after the onset. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 using the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Favipiravir, methylprednisolone, and unfractionated heparin were administered, but she only tested negative 68 days after the onset, at which point she was discharged. However, she was transferred back to our hospital 80 days after the onset since she tested positive again. She was transferred to another hospital 110 days after the onset without testing negative. Case 2 was a 102-year-old female. Despite being a mild case, it took 32 days to obtain negative PCR findings, leading to a decline in the activities of daily living. Case 3 was a 90-year-old male patient treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone, and unfractionated heparin, but his condition deteriorated. He never tested negative for PCR and ultimately died 20 days after the onset. Reports suggest that PCR positivity does not necessarily indicate infectivity, but there are no clear criteria for lifting a quarantine. Therefore, PCR negativity is often sought for ""peace of mind."" In the current situation where hospitals are fully occupied, clear criteria for lifting the quarantine should be promptly determined. After the completion of treatment, it is more important to monitor symptoms and take standard precautions, such as daily health monitoring, wearing a mask, and keeping an appropriate distance from others, than to obtain a negative PCR result."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions from patients without ocular symptoms.,"Purpose: To evaluate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival secretions from patients without ocular symptoms. Methods: Conjunctival swabs were prospectively collected from laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients without ocular symptoms for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. Results: A total of 158 conjunctival swabs were obtained from 49 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The median duration of illness when the first conjunctival swab was obtained was 10 days (range 2-27 days). Four conjunctival swabs from four different patients (4/49, 8.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The Ct values ranged from 32.7 to 37.7 (mean 35.4). Viral cultures were negative for all four RT-PCR-positive conjunctival swabs. Conclusion: Conjunctival secretions of a minority of COVID-19 patients without ocular symptoms may contain relatively low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but their infectiousness remains undetermined. Appropriate infection control measures should be implemented during ophthalmological assessment of COVID-19 patients to prevent potential nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2."
Organizational aspects of pediatric anesthesia and surgery between two waves of Covid-19.,"Background: The initial wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit Italy, and Lombardy in particular, with violence, forcing to reshape all hospitals' activities; this happened even in pediatric hospitals, although the young population seemed initially spared from the disease. ""Vittore Buzzi"" Children's Hospital, which is a pediatric/maternal hospital located in Milan (Lombardy Region), had to stop elective procedures-with the exception of urgent/emergent ones-between February and May 2020 to leave space and resources to adults' care. We describe the challenges of reshaping the hospital's identity and structure, and restarting pediatric surgery and anesthesia, from May on, in the most hit area of the world, with the purpose to avoid and contain infections. Both patients and caregivers admitted to hospital have been tested for Sars-CoV-2 in every case. Methods: Observational cohort study via review of clinical charts of patients undergoing surgery between 16th May and 30th September 2020, together with SARS-CoV -2 RT-PCR testing outcomes, and comparison to same period surgeries in 2019. Results: An increase of approximately 70% in pediatric surgeries (OR 1.68 [1.33-2.13], P < .001) and a higher increase in the number of surgeries were reported (OR 1.75 (1.43-2.15), P < .001). Considering only urgent procedures, a significant difference in the distribution of the type of surgery was observed (Chi-squared P-value < .001). Sars-CoV-2-positive patients have been 0.8% of total number; 14% of these was discovered through caregiver's positivity. Conclusion: We describe our pathway for safe pediatric surgery and anesthesia and the importance of testing both patient and caregiver."
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines - the biggest medical research project of the 21st century.,"SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in more than 141 million people and caused more than 3 million deaths worldwide. To reduce the additional loss of millions of lives until natural immunity is reached, researchers have focused on the only known method to stop the COVID-19 pandemic: vaccines. The pandemic has propelled high-speed vaccine development, some based on novel technology previously not utilized in the vaccine field. The new technology opens new possibilities and comes with challenges because the long-term performance of the new platforms is unknown. Here we review the current leading vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and outline the advantages and disadvantages as well as the unknowns of each candidate."
Hedonic and eudaimonic well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: The role of stigma and appraisals.,"Objectives: This study examines perceived and anticipated stigma towards infected people, threat and impact appraisals of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as distressing personal experiences related to the virus in order to determine the extent to which they directly and indirectly predict hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Investigated experiences included exposure to COVID-19-related news, having being in close proximity to people with a COVID-19 diagnosis or with COVID-19-like symptoms, having being sick or having suffered COVID-19-like symptoms, having tested negative for COVID-19. Methods: Adults from northern Italy (n = 326; M age = 29.86) provided cross-sectional data through an online survey during the nationwide lockdown period. Structural equation modelling analyses were conducted. Results: Perceived and anticipated stigma, exposure to COVID-19 news, perceived threat and impact on material resources access were negatively and indirectly related to both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being via perceived COVID-19 psychological impact which served as a mediator. Perceived stigma was also directly and negatively related to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, whereas having tested negative for COVID diagnosis was positively and directly associated with eudaimonic well-being. Conclusions: COVID-19-related stigma and appraisals can impair positive feelings about life as well as the pursuit of self-realization and the search for meaning in life. The findings highlight the importance of developing psychological preventive and rehabilitative interventions to help people cope with these risk factors."
Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance for Community Transmitted COVID-19 in the Emergency Department.,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, manifests as a respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and is the cause of an ongoing pandemic. The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Methods: We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. Results: Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. Conclusion: Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits."
Association Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Immune-Mediated Myopathy in Patients Who Have Died.,"Importance: Myalgia, increased levels of creatine kinase, and persistent muscle weakness have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Objective: To study skeletal muscle and myocardial inflammation in patients with COVID-19 who had died. Design, setting, and participants: This case-control autopsy series was conducted in a university hospital as a multidisciplinary postmortem investigation. Patients with COVID-19 or other critical illnesses who had died between March 2020 and February 2021 and on whom an autopsy was performed were included. Individuals for whom informed consent to autopsy was available and the postmortem interval was less than 6 days were randomly selected. Individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 per polymerase chain reaction test results and had clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 were compared with individuals with negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results and an absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures: Inflammation of skeletal muscle tissue was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigens on the sarcolemma, and a blinded evaluation on a visual analog scale ranging from absence of pathology to the most pronounced pathology. Inflammation of cardiac muscles was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates. Results: Forty-three patients with COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 72 [16] years; 31 men [72%]) and 11 patients with diseases other than COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [5] years; 7 men [64%]) were included. Skeletal muscle samples from the patients who died with COVID-19 showed a higher overall pathology score (mean [SD], 3.4 [1.8] vs 1.5 [1.0]; 95% CI, 0-3; P < .001) and a higher inflammation score (mean [SD], 3.5 [2.1] vs 1.0 [0.6]; 95% CI, 0-4; P < .001). Relevant expression of MHC class I antigens on the sarcolemma was present in 23 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (55%) and upregulation of MHC class II antigens in 7 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (17%), but neither were found in any of the controls. Increased numbers of natural killer cells (median [interquartile range], 8 [8] vs 3 [4] cells per 10 high-power fields; 95% CI, 1-10 cells per 10 high-power fields; P < .001) were found. Skeletal muscles showed more inflammatory features than cardiac muscles, and inflammation was most pronounced in patients with COVID-19 with chronic courses. In some muscle specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but no evidence for a direct viral infection of myofibers was found by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Conclusions and relevance: In this case-control study of patients who had died with and without COVID-19, most individuals with severe COVID-19 showed signs of myositis ranging from mild to severe. Inflammation of skeletal muscles was associated with the duration of illness and was more pronounced than cardiac inflammation. Detection of viral load was low or negative in most skeletal and cardiac muscles and probably attributable to circulating viral RNA rather than genuine infection of myocytes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a postinfectious, immune-mediated myopathy."
Unpacking Pandora From Its Box: Deciphering the Molecular Basis of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus.,"An enigmatic localized pneumonia escalated into a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review aims to consolidate the extensive biological minutiae of SARS-CoV-2 which requires decipherment. Having one of the largest RNA viral genomes, the single strand contains the genes ORF1ab, S, E, M, N and ten open reading frames. Highlighting unique features such as stem-loop formation, slippery frameshifting sequences and ribosomal mimicry, SARS-CoV-2 represents a formidable cellular invader. Hijacking the hosts translational engine, it produces two polyprotein repositories (pp1a and pp1ab), armed with self-cleavage capacity for production of sixteen non-structural proteins. Novel glycosylation sites on the spike trimer reveal unique SARS-CoV-2 features for shielding and cellular internalization. Affording complexity for superior fitness and camouflage, SARS-CoV-2 challenges diagnosis and vaccine vigilance. This review serves the scientific community seeking in-depth molecular details when designing drugs to curb transmission of this biological armament."
Development and validation of a new triplex real-time quantitative reverse Transcriptase-PCR assay for the clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"To increase the repertoire of PCR based laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we describe a new multiplex assay (SORP), targeting the SARS-CoV-2's, Spike and ORF8 genes. The widely used human RNaseP internal control was modified to specifically co-amplify the RNaseP mRNA. The SORP triplex assay was tested on a cohort (n = 372; POS = 144/NEG = 228) of nasopharyngeal flocked swab (NPFS) specimens, previously tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a PCR assay targeting E and RdRp genes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the SORP assay was: 99.31% (95% CI: 96.22-99.98%), 100.0% (95% CI: 98.4-100%) respectively. The SORP assay could also detect a panel of variants of concern (VOC) from the B1.1.7 (UK) and B1.351 (SA) lineage. In summary, access to a repertoire of new SARS-CoV-2 LDT's would assist diagnostic laboratories in developing strategies to overcome some of the testing issues encountered during high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing."
Viral targets for vaccines against COVID-19.,"Vaccines are urgently needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to help the return to pre-pandemic normalcy. A great many vaccine candidates are being developed, several of which have completed late-stage clinical trials and are reporting positive results. In this Progress article, we discuss which viral elements are used in COVID-19 vaccine candidates, why they might act as good targets for the immune system and the implications for protective immunity."
"[COVID-19 - BLOOD GROUPS, ANTIBODIES AND CONVALESCENT PLASMA].","Israel is currently struggling with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2. Transmission is increasing, with higher morbidity and mortality among populations at risk. Over-representation of blood type A was reported in COVID-19 patients with increased respiratory failure, while blood type O seems to have a protective effect. This may be caused by interference of anti-A antibodies in viral binding to the ACE receptor, different neutralization antibodies potency or variations in the stability of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in different blood types. Since transfusion of convalescent COVID19 Plasma (CCP) is an accepted therapeutic modality, the Ministry of Health initiated a national project whereby CCP is collected by Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Services using apheresis procedures and transfusions are approved by an experts committee, as part of the clinical trial or as compassionate treatment. Preliminary analysis of 49/170 patients treated so far shows improvement in 49%, with important relations with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies level in the transfused plasma. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of 1100 CCP donors, but a 13% decrease in antibodies level was detected in repeat donations. Blood type A was more predominant among CCP donors, when compared to MDA blood donors' data. A transfusion of CCP is a feasible and relatively safe therapeutic modality, mainly for patients with moderate COVID 19. CCP also serves as a source for the production of hyperimmune globulin for the treatment of COVID 19 and for passive immunization for populations at risk."
"Recent progress in understanding 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with human respiratory disease: detection, mechanisms and treatment.","Viral respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) always pose a severe threat to people. First identified in late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2) has affected many provinces in China and multiple countries worldwide. The viral outbreak has aroused panic and a public-health emergency around the world, and the number of infections continues to rise. However, the causes and consequences of the pneumonia remain unknown. To effectively implement epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis are critical to disease control. Here we scrutinise a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection."
Aortoenteric fistula after endovascular mycotic aortic aneurysm exclusion: lessons learned during the COVID-19 era.,"We report a case of aortoenteric fistula 2 years following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic aneurysm presenting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Initial CT angiogram did not reveal the bleeding or connection to bowel, but endoscopy was suspicious of endograft in the duodenum. Management required a multidisciplinary approach. To stabilise the patient and to control bleeding, a 'bridging' endograft extension was performed. This was followed by open surgical removal of the EVAR endograft and lower limb in situ revascularisation. During postoperative recovery, the patient developed atypical, staged multisystemic symptoms (cardiac, pulmonary and neurological). With increasing awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient was found SARS-CoV-2-positive, which explained the progression of his symptoms. This was also reflected on other case reports in literature later."
How glycobiology can help us treat and beat the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged during the last months of 2019, spreading throughout the world as a highly transmissible infectious illness designated as COVID-19. Vaccines have now appeared, but the challenges in producing sufficient material and distributing them around the world means that effective treatments to limit infection and improve recovery are still urgently needed. This review focuses on the relevance of different glycobiological molecules that could potentially serve as or inspire therapeutic tools during SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, we highlight the glycobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, where glycans on viral proteins and on host glycosaminoglycans have critical roles in efficient infection. We also take notice of the glycan-binding proteins involved in the infective capacity of virus and in human defense. In addition, we critically evaluate the glycobiological contribution of candidate drugs for COVID-19 therapy such as glycans for vaccines, anti-glycan antibodies, recombinant lectins, lectin inhibitors, glycosidase inhibitors, polysaccharides, and numerous glycosides, emphasizing some opportunities to repurpose FDA-approved drugs. For the next-generation drugs suggested here, biotechnological engineering of new probes to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be based on the essential glycobiological insight on glycosyltransferases, glycans, glycan-binding proteins, and glycosidases related to this pathology."
Selecting pharmacies for COVID-19 testing to ensure access.,"Rapid diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is key to guiding social distancing orders and containing emerging disease clusters by contact tracing and isolation. However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 ZIP code areas for pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density."
Positive control synthesis method for COVID-19 diagnosis by one-step real-time RT-PCR.,"Backgrounds: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as a gold-standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, unexpected contamination of synthesized positive control samples included in COVID-19 test kits have increased the inconclusiveness of disease interpretation. Therefore, it is important to establish new methods for the preparation of reliable positive controls that are not affected by contamination for the accurate for diagnosis of COVID-19, but it still remains a challenge. Methods: A new approach for producing synthetic positive controls using synthetic positive template (SPT) oligonucleotides was designed. SPT oligonucleotides contain probe binding and virus-irrelevant regions were used as templates for real-time PCR to evaluate the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 genes (RdRP, E, and N). The limit of detection (LOD) for individual SARS-CoV-2 genes by Ct values with different concentrations of SPT templates and genomic RNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples was determined. Results: LODs with SPT templates were >10-15 (atto) M for RdRP, 10-12 (femto) to 10-13 (100 atto) M for E gene, and 10-12 to 10-14 (10 atto) M for N gene, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR assay using serially diluted genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2 virus infected cultures showed that picogram quantities of RNAs is resulted in the LOD. The sensitivity of RdRP and E genes based on Ct values was less than that of N gene with this platform. Conclusion: This method significantly reduces the risk of false-positive reactions resulting from contamination in the synthesis procedures of positive control materials. Therefore, this approach could be integrated into the currrently available COVID-19 test kits and will provide a general method for preparing positive controls in the diagnosis of emerging RNA virus infections."
Potential effects of COVID-19 on reproductive systems and fertility; assisted reproductive technology guidelines and considerations: a review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the renin-angiotensin system for viral entry. The ACE2 receptor is present in both female and male reproductive systems, and reports of multi-organ involvement have led to uncertainty regarding its effects on the reproductive system and fertility. We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality. Higher expression of ACE2 in the endometrium with age and during the secretory phase raises concern about increased susceptibility to infection during periods of high ACE2 expression. The possibility of vertical transmission and the presence of ACE2 in the placenta and during pregnancy are also discussed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen is controversial, but impaired semen quality has been found in men with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Evidence of orchitis and hormonal changes seen in male coronavirus disease 2019 infection may lead to infertility. The implications of these effects on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes are also explored. The ART guidelines from different fertility societies for the management of patients treated with ART are provided. The importance of prioritising 'time-sensitive' patients for ART, counselling patients about the uncertainty and risks of ART, and pregnancy during the pandemic is discussed. Recommendations are also provided for infection control and safe regulation of ART centres and laboratories."
Intranasal vaccination with a lentiviral vector protects against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical animal models.,"To develop a vaccine candidate against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we generated a lentiviral vector (LV) eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, confers only partial protection despite high levels of serum neutralizing activity. However, eliciting an immune response in the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost results in a >3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and reduces local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms display strong vaccine efficacy and inhibit lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and closely mirror human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of LV-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and designate intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19."
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic: how does it spread and how do we stop it?,"Purpose of review: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health threat associated with major socioeconomic disruptions. Understanding on the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for optimizing preventive strategies. Recent findings: SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted efficiently between persons through respiratory droplets and direct and indirect contact. The significance of airborne droplet nuclei in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community setting is less clear. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and live viral particles may also be detected in other bodily fluids. Outbreaks have been reported in families, nursing homes, markets, restaurants, churches, shipping vessels, gyms, and healthcare facilities. Nonpharmaceutical preventive measures at both the community and individual levels are essential for reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Summary: Because well tolerated and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to be widely available in the near future, there is an urgent need for finding other measures to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. With better understanding of its transmission characteristics, practical nonpharmaceutical preventive measures remain essential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and its associated health and socioeconomic burdens."
Longitudinal detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses with different serological methods.,"Serological testing for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies is used to detect ongoing or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. To study the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to assess the diagnostic performances of eight serological assays, we used 129 serum samples collected on known days post symptom onset (dpso) from 42 patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 54 serum samples from healthy blood donors, and children infected with seasonal coronaviruses. The sera were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) based on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. They were further tested for antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (IgG, IgA) and against the viral nucleocapsid protein (IgG, IgM) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The assay specificities were 94.4%-100%. The sensitivities varied largely between assays, reflecting their respective purposes. The sensitivities of IgA and IgM assays were the highest between 11 and 20 dpso, whereas the sensitivities of IgG assays peaked between 20 and 60 dpso. IIFT showed the highest sensitivities due to the use of the whole SARS-CoV-2 as substrate and provided information on whether or not the individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays provided further information about both the prevalence and concentration of specific antibodies against selected antigens of SARS-CoV-2."
Pharmacogenetics Approach for the Improvement of COVID-19 Treatment.,"The treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a challenge. The efficacy of several drugs has been evaluated and variability in drug response has been observed. Pharmacogenetics could explain this variation and improve patients' outcomes with this complex disease; nevertheless, several disease-related issues must be carefully reviewed in the pharmacogenetic study of COVID-19 treatment. We aimed to describe the pharmacogenetic variants reported for drugs used for COVID-19 treatment (remdesivir, oseltamivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and dexamethasone). In addition, other factors relevant to the design of pharmacogenetic studies were mentioned. Variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CY2D6, ABCB1, ABCC2, and SLCO1B1, among other variants, could be included in pharmacogenetic studies of COVID-19 treatment. Besides, nongenetic factors such as drug-drug interactions and inflammation should be considered in the search for personalized therapy of COVID-19."
Strategy to identify priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: A population based cohort study.,"Background: Evidence from COVID-19 outbreak shows that individuals with specific chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe prognosis after infection. Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. Methods: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. Results: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). Conclusion: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population."
Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection.,"Background: The easy access to a quick diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a key point to improve the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to contain its spread. Up to now, laboratory real-time PCR is the standard of care, but requires a fully equipped laboratory and significant infrastructure. Consequently, new diagnostic tools are required. Methods: In the present work, the diagnostic accuracy of the point-of-care rapid test ""bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19"" (Hyris Ltd) is evaluated by a retrospective and a prospective analysis on SARS CoV-2 samples previously assessed with an FDA ""authorized for the emergency use-EUA"" reference method. Descriptive statistics were used for the present study. Results: Results obtained with the Hyris Kit are the same as that of standard laboratory-based real time PCR methods for all the analyzed samples. In addition, the Hyris Kit provides the test results in less than 2 h, a significantly shorter time compared to the reference methods, without the need of a fully equipped laboratory. Conclusions: To conclude, the Hyris kit represents a promising tool to improve the health surveillance and to increase the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 testing."
Manipulation of genes could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes COVID-19 pandemics.,"The year 2020 witnessed an unpredictable pandemic situation due to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks. This condition can be more severe if the patient has comorbidities. Failure of viable treatment for such viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to lack of identification. Thus, modern and productive biotechnology-based tools are being used to manipulate target genes by introducing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Moreover, it has now been used as a tool to inhibit viral replication. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the CRISPR/Cas system can be a viable tool to target both the SARS-CoV-2 genome with specific target RNA sequence and host factors to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 community via inhibition of viral replication and infection. Moreover, comorbidities and COVID-19 escalate the rate of mortality globally, and as a result, we have faced this pandemic. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic manipulation to knockdown viral sequences may be a preventive strategy against such pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) along with CRISPR/Cas13d efficiently degrades the specific RNA sequence to inhibit viral replication. Therefore, we suggest that CRISPR/Cas system with PAC-MAN could be a useful tool to fight against such a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This is an alternative preventive approach of management against the pandemic to destroy the target sequence of RNA in SARS-CoV-2 by viral inhibition."
Immunological imprinting of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients.,"In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), humans are also susceptible to six other coronaviruses, for which consecutive exposures to antigenically related and divergent seasonal coronaviruses are frequent. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing research, the nature of the antibody response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here we longitudinally profile the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 229E seasonal coronaviruses, and find a strong back-boosting effect to conserved but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein. However, such antibody memory boost to human coronaviruses negatively correlates with the induction of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein. Our findings thus provide evidence of immunological imprinting by previous seasonal coronavirus infections that can potentially modulate the antibody profile to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors after the first COVID-19 wave in Canada.,"Background: Case detection underestimates the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the first COVID-19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors across Canada. Study design and methods: This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population-level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups, and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at 2-week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS-CoV-2 reactive to non-reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. Results: Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self-identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero-reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. Discussion: Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While >99% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities."
COVID-19 autopsy in people who died in community settings: the first series.,"Here, we report the pathological findings of nine complete autopsies of individuals who died in community settings in the UK, three of which were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), three tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but are likely false negatives, and three died of other respiratory infections. Autopsy revealed firm, consolidated lungs or lobar pneumonia. Histology of the lungs showed changes of diffuse alveolar damage with fibrin membrane formation, thickened alveolar walls and interstitium with lymphocytic infiltrate, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia with shedding into the alveolar space. This series is the first in the world to describe autopsy findings in individuals dying suddenly in the community, not previously known to have COVID-19 infection, and the first autopsy series in the UK. During a time when testing in the UK is currently primarily offered to patients in hospital or symptomatic key workers, with limited testing available in community settings, it highlights the importance of testing for COVID-19 at autopsy. Two deaths occurred in care homes where a diagnosis of COVID-19 allowed the health protection team to provide support in that 'closed setting' to reduce the risks of onward transmission. This work highlights the need for frequent COVID-19 testing in the management of patients in community settings. Comprehensive virology and microbiology assessment is pivotal to correctly identify the cause of death, including those due to COVID-19 infection, and to derive accurate death statistics."
Does reactogenicity after a second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine predict spike IgG antibody levels in healthy Japanese subjects?,"Background: Adverse reactions are more common after the second injection of messenger RNA vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2. We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). Methods and results: Blood samples were obtained from 67 Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0-11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 855-1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (95% CI: 14,622-20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, AE score after the first injection, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection. Conclusions: Although the sample size was relatively small, reactogenicity after the second injection may not accurately reflect antibody production."
Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity Among US Health Care Personnel.,"Importance: Risks for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care personnel (HCP) are unclear. Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP with the a priori hypothesis that community exposure but not health care exposure was associated with seropositivity. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted among volunteer HCP at 4 large health care systems in 3 US states. Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set. Residential weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence was calculated from state-based COVID-19 case and census data. Exposures: Model variables included demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity), community (known COVID-19 contact, COVID-19 cumulative incidence by 3-digit zip code prefix), and health care (workplace, job role, COVID-19 patient contact) factors. Main outcome and measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site. Results: Among 24 749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17 233 [69.6%]), were women (19 361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15 157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12 413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 in the community up to 1 week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20 072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). No assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity, including nurse job role (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), working in the emergency department (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3), or workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3). Conclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US HCP in 3 states, community exposures were associated with seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, but workplace factors, including workplace role, environment, or contact with patients with known COVID-19, were not. These findings provide reassurance that current infection prevention practices in diverse health care settings are effective in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP."
"A brief molecular insight of COVID-19: epidemiology, clinical manifestation, molecular mechanism, cellular tropism and immuno-pathogenesis.","In December 2019, the emergence and expansion of novel and infectious respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China caused an unprecedented threat to the public health and became a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive sense and single stranded RNA virus belonging to genera betacoronavirus, of Coronaviridae family. The viral genome sequencing studies revealed 75-80% similarity with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the lower respiratory system and may progress to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Apart from life-threatening situations and burden on the global healthcare system, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed several challenges on the worldwide economics and livelihood. The novel pathogen is highly virulent, rapidly mutating and has a tendency to cross the species boundaries such as from bats to humans through the evolution and natural selection from intermediate host. In this review we tried to summarize the overall picture of SARS-CoV-2 including origin/ emergence, epidemiology, pathogenesis, genome organization, comparative analysis with other CoVs, infection and replication mechanism along with cellular tropism and immunopathogenesis which will provide a brief panoramic view about the virus and disease."
AGA Rapid Review and Guideline for SARS-CoV2 Testing and Endoscopy Post-Vaccination: 2021 Update.,"This guideline provides updated recommendations on the role of preprocedure testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in individuals undergoing endoscopy in the post-vaccination period and replaces the prior guideline from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) (released July 29, 2020). Since the start of the pandemic, our increased understanding of transmission has facilitated the implementation of practices to promote patient and health care worker (HCW) safety. Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care, as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGA's prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy; patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy; effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission; patient and HCW anxiety; patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden; and endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine preprocedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy. The panel placed a high value on minimizing additional delays in patient care, acknowledging the reduced endoscopy volumes, downstream impact on delayed cancer diagnoses, and burden of testing on patients."
Long-term monitoring of the development and extinction of IgA and IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Despite the great interest of the scientific community in the behavior of the human body after contact with the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), long-term (more than 6 months) monitoring of the immunological status of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) having varying severity degrees and of the people with a low SARS-CoV-2 viral load is practically absent. The aim of this study is a 9-month monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection immune response development and extinction using quantitative assessment of IgA and IgG levels in the blood of healthy donors living in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and of the patients who have undergone COVID-19. The project involved 180 volunteers, of whom 51 persons (28.33%) fell ill with COVID-19 during the observation period. All people who underwent COVID-19 developed a stable humoral immune response but their individual immune status had a number of features. Approximately 39.22% (20 of 51 people) of project participants diagnosed with COVID-19 showed an unusual change in plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA levels. Relatively high levels of IgA (ratio ~ 3) after recovery persisted for a long time (more than 6 months). In one-third (17 of 51 people) of patients with COVID-19, the IgA level exceeded the IgG level. IgA antibodies appeared earlier and showed a stronger and more robust response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than IgG. Increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA (ratio from 0.8 to 2.36) throughout the observation period were recorded in 28 of 180 project participants (15.56%) of whom only one person fell ill with COVID-19."
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma samples of COVID-19 affected individuals: a cross-sectional proof-of-concept study.,"Background: Recent studies showed that plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA seems to be associated with worse COVID-19 outcome. However, whether specific population can be at higher risk of viremia are to date unexplored. Methods: This cross-sectional proof-of-concept study included 41 SARS-CoV-2-positive adult individuals (six affected by haematological malignancies) hospitalized at two major hospital in Milan, for those demographic, clinical and laboratory data were available. SARS-CoV-2 load was quantified by ddPCR in paired plasma and respiratory samples. To assess significant differences between patients with and patients without viremia, Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon test were used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results: Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 8 patients (19.5%), with a median (IQR) value of 694 (209-1023) copies/mL. Viremic patients were characterized by an higher mortality rate (50.0% vs 9.1%; p = 0.018) respect to patients without viremia. Viremic patients were more frequently affected by haematological malignancies (62.5% vs. 3.0%; p < 0.001), and had higher viral load in respiratory samples (9,404,000 [586,060-10,000,000] vs 1560 [312-25,160] copies/mL; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Even if based on a small sample population, this proof-of-concept study poses the basis for an early identification of patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 viremia, and therefore likely to develop severe COVID-19, and supports the need of a quantitative viral load determination in blood and respiratory samples of haematologic patients with COVID-19 in order to predict prognosis and consequently to help their further management."
Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Transmission Among US Air Force Trainees in a Congregant Setting.,"Importance: Owing to concerns of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, many congregant settings are forced to close when cases are detected because there are few data on the risk of different markers of transmission within groups. Objective: To determine whether symptoms and laboratory results on the first day of COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with development of a case cluster in a congregant setting. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study of trainees with COVID-19 from May 11 through August 24, 2020, was conducted at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, the primary site of entry for enlistment in the US Air Force. Symptoms and duration, known contacts, and cycle threshold for trainees diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were collected. A cycle threshold value represents the number of nucleic acid amplification cycles that occur before a specimen containing the target material generates a signal greater than the predetermined threshold that defines positivity. Cohorts with 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection were defined as clusters. Participants included 10 613 trainees divided into 263 parallel cohorts of 30 to 50 people arriving weekly for 7 weeks of training. Exposures: All trainees were quarantined for 14 days on arrival. Testing was performed on arrival, on day 14, and anytime during training when indicated. Protective measures included universal masking, physical distancing, and rapid isolation of trainees with COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures: Association between days of symptoms, specific symptoms, number of symptoms, or cycle threshold values of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent transmission within cohorts. Results: In this cohort study of 10 613 US Air Force basic trainees in 263 cohorts, 403 trainees (3%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 in 129 cohorts (49%). Among trainees with COVID-19 infection, 318 (79%) were men, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 20 (19-23) years; 204 (51%) were symptomatic, and 199 (49%) were asymptomatic. Median (IQR) cycle threshold values were lower in symptomatic trainees compared with asymptomatic trainees (21.2 [18.4-27.60] vs 34.8 [29.3-37.4]; P < .001). Cohorts with clusters of individuals with COVID-19 infection were predominantly men (204 cohorts [89%] vs 114 cohorts [64%]; P < .001), had more symptomatic trainees (146 cohorts [64%] vs 53 cohorts [30%]; P < .001), and had more median (IQR) symptoms per patient (3 [2-5] vs 1 [1-2]; P < .001) compared with cohorts without clusters. Within cohorts, subsequent development of clusters of 5 or more individuals with COVID-19 infection compared with those that did not develop clusters was associated with cohorts that had more symptomatic trainees (31 of 58 trainees [53%] vs 43 of 151 trainees [28%]; P = .001) and lower median (IQR) cycle threshold values (22.3 [18.4-27.3] vs 35.3 [26.5-37.8]; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of US Air Force trainees living in a congregant setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, higher numbers of symptoms and lower cycle threshold values were associated with subsequent development of clusters of individuals with COVID-19 infection. These values may be useful if validated in future studies."
Clinical characteristics of acute respiratory syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children in South China.,"Background: A retrospective study was conducted to summarize the clinical information of childhood infections during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. Methods: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 11 hospitals from three provinces of South China were included in the study. Clinical information was collected and compared with children and adults infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Results: In total, 52 children were enrolled, including 28 boys. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-12); 44.2% cases were of clustered occurrences, 40.4% patients had fever, 48.1% had cough, and 46.2% had a high lymphocyte count. No abnormalities were found in the liver and kidney function. Also, 82.7% of patients received antiviral therapy, but such therapy did not shorten the time to virus negativity or hospital stay (P = .082). The time to virus negativity was 12.0 days (IQR, 8.0-16.8) and hospital stay was 14.5 days (IQR, 10.3-17.9). Compared with reports in Wuhan, there were more acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and fewer pneumonia cases (P = .000). Compared with the non-ICU adult COVID-19 in Wuhan, these children's diseases were relatively mild, with fewer complications. Conclusions: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a mild fever, lymphocyte elevation was more common than reduction, and antiviral treatment had no obvious effect. The overall clinical manifestations were mild, and the prognosis was good."
Human Challenge Studies to Accelerate Coronavirus Vaccine Licensure.,"Controlled human challenge trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines. By replacing conventional phase 3 testing of vaccine candidates, such trials may subtract many months from the licensure process, making efficacious vaccines available more quickly. Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death. However, we argue that such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity. Volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection, if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection, and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care."
Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center.,"Background: The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. Methods: This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant (SOT), bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 0.3%-2.4%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared with other groups. Conclusions: Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3%-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults."
Inactivated rabies virus vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prevents disease in a Syrian hamster model.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials."
COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in three teenagers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generally a relatively mild illness in children. An emerging disease entity coined as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) has been reported recently, but is very rare and only affects a very small minority of children. Here we describe the clinical presentations and outcomes of three teenagers with serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for PIMS-TS. Although their initial presentations were very similar, their COVID-19-related disease varied in severity."
"Benefits and risks associated with different uses of the COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria: a modelling study, France, May to September 2021.","Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) has been identified as a rare adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination with Vaxzevria. We modelled the benefits and risks of Vaxzevria distribution from May to September 2021 in metropolitan France where other vaccines are available, considering French hospitalisation data and European data on TTS. Across different scenarios, benefits of Vaxzevria distribution in people 55 years and older exceeded the risk of death from COVID-19. In young adults, risks were at least of similar magnitude as benefits."
Early Virus Clearance and Delayed Antibody Response in a Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) With a History of Coinfection With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus.,"The effect of host immune status on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown. Here, we report the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/hepatitis C virus coinfection, who showed a persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma. This case highlights the influence of HIV-1-induced immune dysfunction on early SARS-CoV-2 clearance."
An in-depth in silico and immunoinformatics approach for designing a potential multi-epitope construct for the effective development of vaccine to combat against SARS-CoV-2 encompassing variants of concern and interest.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the latest of the several viral pathogens that have acted as a threat to human health around the world. Thus, to prevent COVID-19 and control the outbreak, the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most important strategies at present. The study aimed to design a multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-CoV-2. For the development of a more effective vaccine, 1549 nucleotide sequences were taken into consideration, including the variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and, B.1.617.2) and variants of interest (B.1.427, B.1.429, B.1.526, B.1.617.1 and P.2). A total of 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, N, E, M, ORF1ab polyprotein, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10) were targeted for T-cell epitope prediction and S protein was targeted for B-cell epitope prediction. MEV was constructed using linkers and adjuvant beta-defensin. The vaccine construct was verified, based on its antigenicity, physicochemical properties, and its binding potential, with toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4), ACE2 receptor and B cell receptor. The selected vaccine construct showed considerable binding with all the receptors and a significant immune response, including elevated antibody titer and B cell population along with augmented activity of TH cells, Tc cells and NK cells. Thus, immunoinformatics and in silico-based approaches were used for constructing MEV which is capable of eliciting both innate and adaptive immunity. In conclusion, the vaccine construct developed in this study has all the potential for the development of a next-generation vaccine which may in turn effectively combat the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 identified so far. However, in vitro and animal studies are warranted to justify our findings for its utility as probable preventive measure."
[The Leon Fredericq Foundation against COVID-19 in Liege].,"The Leon Fredericq Foundation gives support to the clinicians and the scientists of the Uliege and of the CHU of Liege in order to push back the frontiers of biomedical science and to contribute to improve the care and cure of patients. Since the outbreak due to COVID-19, the Foundation has given out a call for donations in order to support urgent procedures for taking care of COVID-19 suffering patients. Furthermore, by raising important financial means, the Foundation has selected thirteen research projects aiming at a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2-induced disease."
A high-throughput drug screening strategy against coronaviruses.,"The emergence and re-emergence of coronaviruses (CoV) continually cause circulating epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV."
YouTube Videos Demonstrating the Nasopharyngeal Swab Technique for SARS-CoV-2 Specimen Collection: Content Analysis.,"Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs is currently the most widely used diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, false negatives and the sensitivity of this mode of testing have posed challenges in the accurate estimation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether technical and, therefore, correctable errors were being made with regard to nasopharyngeal swab procedures. Methods: We searched a web-based video database (YouTube) for videos demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests, posted from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Videos were rated by 3 blinded rhinologists for accuracy of swab angle and depth. The overall score for swab angle and swab depth for each nasopharyngeal swab demonstration video was determined based on the majority score with agreement between at least 2 of the 3 reviewers. We then comparatively evaluated video data collected from YouTube videos demonstrating the correct nasopharyngeal swab technique with data from videos demonstrating an incorrect nasopharyngeal swab technique. Multiple linear regression analysis with statistical significance set at P=.05 was performed to determine video data variables associated with the correct nasopharyngeal swab technique. Results: In all, 126 videos met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 52.3% (66/126) of all videos demonstrated the correct swab angle, and 46% (58/126) of the videos demonstrated an appropriate swab depth. Moreover, 45.2% (57/126) of the videos demonstrated both correct nasopharyngeal swab angle and appropriate depth, whereas 46.8% (59/126) of the videos demonstrated both incorrect nasopharyngeal swab angle and inappropriate depth. Videos with correct nasopharyngeal swab technique were associated with the swab operators identifying themselves as a medical professional or as an Ear, Nose, Throat-related medical professional. We also found an association between correct nasopharyngeal swab techniques and recency of video publication date (relative to May 15, 2020). Conclusions: Our findings show that over half of the videos documenting the nasopharyngeal swab test showed an incorrect technique, which could elevate false-negative test rates. Therefore, greater attention needs to be provided toward educating frontline health care workers who routinely perform nasopharyngeal swab procedures."
"COVID-19: An overview of the current pharmacological interventions, vaccines, and clinical trials.","COVID-19, the greatest public health emergency of the 21st century, has affected 215 countries and territories around the world resulting in 15,151,738 confirmed cases and 621,121 deaths. The outbreak has continued at breakneck pace despite stringent public health measures, ravaging the global economy and causing profound human casualties. Vaccination is currently the best bet for the prevention of COVID-19. Still, in its absence, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing therapeutic agents to reduce the severity of the illness and ease the burden on the already strained healthcare systems. This review outlines the current evidence regarding proposed treatments- experimental or repurposed, for COVID-19, and gives an insight into the clinical trial landscape for drugs as well as vaccines."
Efficient high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing to detect asymptomatic carriers.,"Recent reports suggest that 10 to 30% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infected patients are asymptomatic and that viral shedding may occur before symptom onset. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities to prevent disease spread. We developed P-BEST, a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, which identifies all positive subjects within a set of samples using a single round of testing. Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing. We pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools, providing both an eightfold increase in testing efficiency and an eightfold reduction in test costs, while identifying up to five positive carriers. We then used P-BEST to screen 1115 health care workers using 144 tests. P- BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that can be easily integrated into diagnostic laboratories."
Using Influenza Vaccination Location Data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to Expand COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage.,"Effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution requires prioritizing locations that are accessible to high-risk target populations. However, little is known about the vaccination location preferences of individuals with underlying chronic conditions. Using data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we grouped 162,744 respondents into high-risk and low-risk groups for COVID-19 and analyzed the odds of previous influenza vaccination at doctor's offices, health departments, community settings, stores, or hospitals. Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 were more likely to be vaccinated in doctor's offices and stores and less likely to be vaccinated in community settings."
COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients at the epicenter of pandemics.,"We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization."
"SARS-CoV-2 testing in North Carolina: Racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities.","SARS-CoV-2 testing data in North Carolina during the first three months of the state's COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed to determine if there were disparities among intersecting axes of identity including race, Latinx ethnicity, age, urban-rural residence, and residence in a medically underserved area. Demographic and residential data were used to reconstruct patterns of testing metrics (including tests per capita, positive tests per capita, and test positivity rate which is an indicator of sufficient testing) across race-ethnicity groups and urban-rural populations separately. Across the entire sample, 13.1% (38,750 of 295,642) of tests were positive. Within racial-ethnic groups, 11.5% of all tests were positive among non-Latinx (NL) Whites, 22.0% for NL Blacks, and 66.5% for people of Latinx ethnicity. The test positivity rate was higher among people living in rural areas across all racial-ethnic groups. These results suggest that in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to COVID-19 testing in North Carolina was not evenly distributed across racial-ethnic groups, especially in Latinx, NL Black and other historically marginalized populations, and further disparities existed within these groups by gender, age, urban-rural status, and residence in a medically underserved area."
Pharmacological Predictors of Morbidity and Mortality in COVID-19.,"The interaction of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with the majority of common prescriptions is broadly unknown. The purpose of this study is to identify medications associated with altered disease outcomes in COVID-19. A retrospective cohort composed of all adult inpatient admissions to our center with COVID-19 was analyzed. Data concerning all antecedent prescriptions were collected and agents brought forward for analysis if prescribed to at least 20 patients in our cohort. Forty-two medications and 22 classes of medication were examined. Groups were propensity score matched and analyzed by logistic and linear regression. The majority of medications did not show a statistically significant relationship with altered disease outcomes. Lower mortality was associated with use of pregabalin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.92; P = .049) and inhalers of any type (HR, 0.33; 95%CI, 0.14-0.80; P = .015), specifically beclomethasone (HR, 0.10; 95%CI, 0.01-0.82; P = .032), tiotropium (HR, 0.07; 95%CI, 0.01-0.83; P = .035), and steroid-containing inhalers (HR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.15-0.79; P = .013). Gliclazide (HR, 4.37; 95%CI, 1.26-15.18; P = .020) and proton pump inhibitor (HR, 1.72; 95%CI, 1.06-2.79; P = .028) use was associated with greater mortality. Diuretic (HR, 0.07; 95%CI, 0.01-0.37; P = .002) and statin (HR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.17-0.73; P = .006) use was associated with lower rates of critical care admission. Our data lends confidence to observing usual practice in patients with COVID-19 by continuing antecedent prescriptions in the absence of an alternative acute contraindication. We highlight potential benefits in investigation of diuretics, inhalers, pregabalin, and statins as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 and support further assessment of the safety of gliclazide and proton pump inhibitors in the acute illness."
Potential pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"The emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a serious threat to public health. Notably, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and large amount of people have been infected. There is imminent need to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective therapeutic strategies to contain the epidemic. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry into target cells, with S1 subunit binding to a cellular receptor and S2 subunit fusing viral and host membranes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), previously known as a cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is putatively responsible for mediating COVID-19. In this review, we detail our current understanding of the interaction between S protein and ACE2 in the process of virus infection and the potential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which has critical implications for exploring the potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19."
Prevalence and characteristics of Brazilians aged 50 and over that received a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over half a million deaths worldwide. Brazil has been particularly impacted, registering more than 1.3 million infections and 57,000 deaths by late June 2020. Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite the descriptive and preliminary nature of these findings, results reported here suggest the need for more targeted approaches to enhance personal protection and provide greater viral testing options, especially for older, sicker and more vulnerable adults in Brazil."
Structural insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics development.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). By late October 2020, more than 43 million cases of infections, including over 1.15 million deaths, have been confirmed worldwide. This review focuses on our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their implications on therapeutics development against COVID-19."
SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer: Evidence for and against a role of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer onset.,"Despite huge efforts towards understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis, little is known about the long-term consequences of the disease. Here, we critically review existing literature about oncogenesis as a potential long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like other viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 may promote cancer onset by inhibiting tumor suppressor genes. We conclude that, although unlikely, such hypothesis cannot be excluded a priori and we delineate an experimental approach to address it. Also see the video abstract here: https://youtu.be/TBUTDSLR7vY."
A highly immunogenic and effective measles virus-based Th1-biased COVID-19 vaccine.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide, with millions of cases and more than 1 million deaths to date. The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. Upon challenge using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, virus loads in vaccinated mice were significantly lower, while vaccinated Syrian hamsters revealed protection in a harsh challenge setup using an early-passage human patient isolate. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines."
2019-Novel Coronavirus-Related Acute Cardiac Injury Cannot Be Ignored.,"Purpose of the review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached a pandemic status. Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent findings: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated. We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care."
The Mystery of MIS-C Post-SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Following emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a surge in the life-threatening illness now termed 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children' (MIS-C) has raised questions about the unique effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents. Two important new studies by Consiglio et al. and Gruber et al. have begun to shine light on the immune drivers of this enigmatic disease."
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: a triumph of science and collaboration.,"Roughly 1 year after the first case of COVID-19 was identified and less than 1 year after the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trials are available. The most promising vaccines have targeted the surface glycoprotein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and achieved an approximate 85%-95% reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, while retaining excellent safety profiles and modest side effects in the phase III clinical trials. The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed. Some novel SARS-CoV-2 variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by these vaccines. Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection from severe COVID-19. This is an impressive first demonstration of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine and vector vaccine platforms. The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be credited to open science, industry partnerships, harmonization of clinical trials, and the altruism of study participants. The manufacturing and distribution of the emergency use-authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are ongoing challenges. What remains now is to ensure broad and equitable global vaccination against COVID-19."
Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antigens Using High-Purity Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube-Based Field-Effect Transistors.,"Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for facilitating proper containment procedures, and a rapid, sensitive antigen assay is a critical step in curbing the pandemic. In this work, we report the use of a high-purity semiconducting (sc) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based field-effect transistor (FET) decorated with specific binding chemistry to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in clinical nasopharyngeal samples. Our SWCNT FET sensors, with functionalization of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody (SAb) and anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody, detected the S antigen (SAg) and N antigen (NAg), reaching a limit of detection of 0.55 fg/mL for SAg and 0.016 fg/mL for NAg in calibration samples. SAb-functionalized FET sensors also exhibited good sensing performance in discriminating positive and negative clinical samples, indicating a proof of principle for use as a rapid COVID-19 antigen diagnostic tool with high analytical sensitivity and specificity at low cost."
Comparative analysis of protein synthesis rate in COVID-19 with other human coronaviruses.,"The genetic code contains information that impacts the efficiency and rate of translation. Translation elongation plays a crucial role in determining the composition of the proteome, errors within a protein contributes towards disease processes. It is important to analyze the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) at the codon level to find similarities and variations in hosts to compare with other human coronavirus (CoVs). This requires a comparative and comprehensive study of various human and zoonotic nature CoVs relating to codon usage bias, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), proportions of slow codons, and slow di-codons, the effective number of codons (ENC), mutation bias, codon adaptation index (CAI), and codon frequencies. In this work, seven different CoVs were analyzed to determine the protein synthesis rate and the adaptation of these viruses to the host cell. The result reveals that the proportions of slow codons and slow di-codons in human host of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV found to be similar and very less compared to the other five coronavirus types, which suggest that the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have faster protein synthesis rate. Zoonotic CoVs have high RSCU and codon adaptation index than human CoVs which implies the high translation rate in zoonotic viruses. All CoVs have more AT% than GC% in genetic codon compositions. The average ENC values of seven CoVs ranged between 38.36 and 49.55, which implies the CoVs are highly conserved and are easily adapted to host cells. The mutation rate of 2019-nCoV is comparatively less than MERS-CoV and NL63 that shows an evidence for genetic diversity. Host-specific codon composition analysis portrays the relation between viral host sequences and the capability of novel virus replication in host cells. Moreover, the analysis provides useful measures for evaluating a virus-host adaptation, transmission potential of novel viruses, and thus contributes to the strategies of anti-viral drug design."
Phenotypes and Functions of SARS-CoV-2-Reactive T Cells.,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is an ongoing pandemic disease. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses have been detected and characterized not only in COVID-19 patients and convalescents, but also unexposed individuals. Here, we review the phenotypes and functions of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 patients and the relationships between SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses and COVID-19 severity. In addition, we describe the phenotypes and functions of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells after recovery from COVID-19 and discuss the presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in unexposed individuals and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. A better understanding of T-cell responses is important for effective control of the current COVID-19 pandemic."
Tolerance of BNT162b2 mRNA COVI-19 vaccine in patients with a medical history of COVID-19 disease: A case control study.,"Introduction: Studies evaluating BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety excluded subjects with a previous history of COVID-19 infection. The aim of our study was to focus on the tolerance of this vaccine this population. Methods: An anonymous self-reporting survey related to safety and tolerance of vaccine was completed by subjects 21 to 28 days after the first vaccine dose in two vaccination centers. Results: Subjects with prior COVID-19 disease history (n = 61) had higher systemic reactions than subjects without any previous history (n = 1987) (45.9% vs 29.7%, p = 0.01). Asthenia, headache and fever were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 + group than negative group (25.6% vs 15.2% p = 0.045, 19.7% vs 9.3% p = 0.01, 6.5% vs 0.9% p = 0.003 respectively). Grade of severity was higher in COVID-19 + than in COVID-19 - group (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our study confirms a higher risk of side effects in patients with preexisting SARS-CoV-2 disease but with a good overall tolerance."
Comparison of Tracheal vs Nasopharyngeal Secretions for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing in Patients With Tracheostomy.,"This study compares nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples for COVID-19 viral testing in patients with a tracheostomy. This was a prospective cohort study done at 2 academic hospitals between March and June 2020. Patients admitted through the emergency department who had a COVID-19 test and an existing tracheostomy or underwent a tracheostomy during the admission period were included. Patients with a positive initial nasopharyngeal swab were placed in the experimental group (n = 8), while those with a negative swab were the control group (n = 7). Nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples underwent COVID-19 testing using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay. Fourteen patients underwent tracheostomy, and 1 had an existing tracheostomy. The average duration of viral shedding in nasopharyngeal samples was 20.9 days. One patient (6.7%) tested positive in tracheal secretions after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. In the remaining patients (93.3%), the nasopharyngeal and tracheal specimens correlated."
Report on a lactating patient with COVID-19.,"Case presentation: We report the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a lactating patient in Chizhou, Anhui Province, China. The lactating patient presented with intermittent fever for 16 days and cough for 10 days. Given her travel history to the epidemic area and the chest CT scan results, the patient was immediately admitted to the isolation ward of the Infectious Disease Department and breastfeeding was discontinued. Pharyngeal swab specimens tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) in nucleic acid testing. During hospitalization, she also experienced bilateral breast tenderness. After active treatment, the patient ultimately achieved remission and was discharged from the hospital. Discussion and conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and patient contact, rendering the general population to a high risk of infection. The management of mother-child interactions and breastfeeding in women with COVID-19 is a difficult problem. The purpose of this case report is to help clinicians by improving the understanding of COVID-19, particularly in lactating patients."
Demyelination as a result of an immune response in patients with COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), that already appeared as a global pandemic. Presentation of the disease often includes upper respiratory symptoms like dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and rhinorrhea that can develop to respiratory failure, needing intubation. Furthermore, the occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, headache, and seizures are frequently stated in patients with COVID-19. One of the reported neurological complications of severe COVID-19 is the demolition of the myelin sheath. Indeed, the complex immunological dysfunction provides a substrate for the development of demyelination. Nevertheless, few published reports in the literature describe demyelination in subjects with COVID-19. In this short narrative review, we discuss probable pathological mechanisms that may trigger demyelination in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarize the clinical evidence, confirming SARS-CoV-2 condition as a risk factor for the destruction of myelin."
CoV3D: a database of high resolution coronavirus protein structures.,"SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu."
The impact of COVID-19 on allied health professions.,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) on allied health professionals work environment, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 testing, and mental health. A 34-question survey was developed and distributed electronically to allied health professionals through listservs of professional organizations and social media groups. A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources. Specifically, those with access to mental health support reported lower stress levels than those without such access. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring of mental health for allied health professionals in order to inform clinic and hospital policies for PPE and the development of brief interventions to mitigate adverse long-term mental health outcomes."
Will SARS-CoV-2 Infection Elicit Long-Lasting Protective or Sterilising Immunity? Implications for Vaccine Strategies (2020).,"In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China resulted in the current COVID-19 global pandemic. The human immune system has not previously encountered this virus, raising the important question as to whether or not protective immunity is generated by infection. Growing evidence suggests that protective immunity can indeed be acquired post-infection-although a handful of reinfection cases have been reported. However, it is still unknown whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to some degree of long-lasting protection against the disease or the infection. This review draws insights from previous knowledge regarding the nature and longevity of immunity to the related virus, SARS-CoV, to fill the gaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Deciphering the immunological characteristics that give rise to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to guiding vaccine development and also predicting the course of the pandemic. Here we discuss the recent evidence that characterises the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its potential implications for the generation of memory responses and long-term protection."
"An overview of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of Artemisia annua, its antiviral action, protein-associated mechanisms, and repurposing for COVID-19 treatment.","Artemisia annua and its phytocompounds have a rich history in the research and treatment of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other diseases. Currently, the World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment for multi-drug-resistant malaria. Due to the various research articles on the use of antimalarial drugs to treat coronaviruses, a question is raised: would A. annua and its compounds provide anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) properties? PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed articles that investigated the antiviral effects and mechanisms of A. annua and its phytochemicals against SARS-CoVs. Particularly, articles that evidenced the herb's role in inhibiting the coronavirus-host proteins were favored. Nineteen studies were retrieved. From these, fourteen in silico molecular docking studies demonstrated potential inhibitory properties of artemisinins against coronavirus-host proteins including 3CLPRO, S protein, N protein, E protein, cathepsin-L, helicase protein, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), nsp10, nsp14, nsp15, and glucose-regulated protein 78 receptor. Collectively, A. annua constituents may impede the SARS-CoV-2 attachment, membrane fusion, internalization into the host cells, and hinder the viral replication and transcription process. This is the first comprehensive overview of the application of compounds from A. annua against SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) describing all target proteins. A. annua's biological properties, the signaling pathways implicated in the COVID-19, and the advantages and disadvantages for repurposing A. annua compounds are discussed. The combination of A. annua's biological properties, action on different signaling pathways and target proteins, and a multi-drug combined-therapy approach may synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and assist in the COVID-19 treatment. Also, A. annua may modulate the host immune response to better fight the infection."
Characteristics and Symptoms of App Users Seeking COVID-19-Related Digital Health Information and Remote Services: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background: Patient-facing digital health tools have been promoted to help patients manage concerns related to COVID-19 and to enable remote care and self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also been suggested that these tools can help further our understanding of the clinical characteristics of this new disease. However, there is limited information on the characteristics and use patterns of these tools in practice. Objective: The aims of this study are to describe the characteristics of people who use digital health tools to address COVID-19-related concerns; explore their self-reported symptoms and characterize the association of these symptoms with COVID-19; and characterize the recommendations provided by digital health tools. Methods: This study used data from three digital health tools on the K Health app: a protocol-based COVID-19 self-assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checker, and communication with remote physicians. Deidentified data were extracted on the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults seeking COVID-19-related health information between April 8 and June 20, 2020. Analyses included exploring features associated with COVID-19 positivity and features associated with the choice to communicate with a remote physician. Results: During the period assessed, 71,619 individuals completed the COVID-19 self-assessment, 41,425 also used the AI-driven symptom checker, and 2523 consulted with remote physicians. Individuals who used the COVID-19 self-assessment were predominantly female (51,845/71,619, 72.4%), with a mean age of 34.5 years (SD 13.9). Testing for COVID-19 was reported by 2901 users, of whom 433 (14.9%) reported testing positive. Users who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to have reported loss of smell or taste (relative rate [RR] 6.66, 95% CI 5.53-7.94) and other established COVID-19 symptoms as well as ocular symptoms. Users communicating with a remote physician were more likely to have been recommended by the self-assessment to undergo immediate medical evaluation due to the presence of severe symptoms (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.32). Most consultations with remote physicians (1940/2523, 76.9%) were resolved without need for referral to an in-person visit or to the emergency department. Conclusions: Our results suggest that digital health tools can help support remote care and self-management of COVID-19 and that self-reported symptoms from digital interactions can extend our understanding of the symptoms associated with COVID-19."
[Analysis of CT features of 15 children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection].,"Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important."
First case of convalescent plasma transfusion in a child with COVID-19-associated severe aplastic anemia.,"We present the case of a six-year-old girl with severe COVID-19, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was successfully eliminated after convalescent plasma transfusion. Children show a variable clinical course of COVID-19, from asymptomatic to critical. In our patient, we diagnosed COVID-19-associated aplastic anemia with severe pancytopenia. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection with aplastic anemia remains unclear. At the beginning of the disease, we used antiviral drugs and immune modulators as therapy but without any positive results. After providing a transfusion of convalescent plasma, the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. We did not observe any adverse events of this treatment. The girl still has a diagnosis of aplastic anemia and requires specialist therapy."
Defining the clinical phenotype of COVID-19 in children.,"On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin detected in Wuhan City by Chinese authorities. Since SARS-CoV-2 discovery, the corresponding disease (COVID-19) has rapidly expanded throughout the globe, making as a consequence the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic. As of May 19, 2020, over 4.806.299 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide, with more than 318.599 deaths."
The green tea catechin epigallocatechin gallate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a pandemic with tens of millions of cases and more than a million deaths. The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. No treatment exists. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea, has several beneficial properties, including antiviral activities. Therefore, we examined whether EGCG has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. EGCG blocked not only the entry of SARS-CoV-2, but also MERS- and SARS-CoV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and inhibited virus infections in vitro. Mechanistically, inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor interaction was observed. Thus, EGCG might be suitable for use as a lead structure to develop more effective anti-COVID-19 drugs."
Characteristics of Three Different Chemiluminescence Assays for Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies.,"Several tests based on chemiluminescence immunoassay techniques have become available to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35 days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multigroup study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n = 145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e., healthy blood donors, n = 191, and healthcare workers, n = 1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 7), and endemic common-cold coronavirus infections (n = 12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers' cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval [84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation."
A homogeneous split-luciferase assay for rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies.,"Better diagnostic tools are needed to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, to meet this urgent demand, we report a homogeneous immunoassay to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This serological assay, called SATiN, is based on a tri-part Nanoluciferase (tNLuc) approach, in which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protein G, fused respectively to two different tNLuc tags, are used as antibody probes. Target engagement of the probes allows reconstitution of a functional luciferase in the presence of the third tNLuc component. The assay is performed directly in the liquid phase of patient sera and enables rapid, quantitative and low-cost detection. We show that SATiN has a similar sensitivity to ELISA, and its readouts are consistent with various neutralizing antibody assays. This proof-of-principle study suggests potential applications in diagnostics, as well as disease and vaccination management."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is a critical element of the public health response to COVID-19. Point-of-care (POC) tests can drive patient management decisions for infectious diseases, including COVID-19. POC tests are available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and include those that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as amplified RNA sequences. We provide a review of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests including their performance, settings for which they might be used, their impact and future directions. Further optimization and validation, new technologies as well as studies to determine clinical and epidemiological impact of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests are needed."
Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination - A case series.,"There have been reports of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination. We surveyed all hospitalized military personnel in the Isareli Defense Forces during the period of the COVID-19 vaccination operation (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for diagnosed myocarditis. We identified 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. One case of myocarditis diagnosed 10 days after the second dose of the vaccine was not included. These 8 cases comprise of all events of myocarditis diagnosed in military personnel during this time period. All patients were young and generally healthy. All had mild disease with no sequalae. The incidence of myocarditis in the week following a second dose of the vaccine was 5.07/100,000 people vaccinated. Due to the nature of this report no causality could be established. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. True incidence rates should be further investigated."
The usual course of thorax CT findings of COVID-19 infection and when to perform control thorax CT scan.,"COVID-19 infection, a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus, and the World Health Organization declared this increasingly spreading disease as a global public health emergency (pandemic). In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the reference standard test. In the early stages, thorax CT findings could be present even before the onset of symptoms, thorax CT has quite high sensitivity in COVID-19 patients with false negative RT-PCR results, and it has a great importance not only in diagnosis but also in follow up. We think that it might be beneficial for our radiologist colleagues in the early diagnosis of the imaging features of this disease, by sharing the experiences we have gained by evaluating the typical and relatively atypical CT findings regarding the natural course of the tomographic findings of COVID-19 and when to control CT."
A 59-Year-Old Woman with Extensive Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism 7 Days Following a First Dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing cause of the current global healthcare crisis. Several vaccines were approved for use by emergency vaccination campaigns worldwide. At present, there are very few reports of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune-thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a variant of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), in comparison to the massive number of vaccinated people worldwide. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of sudden-onset left leg pain 7 days after receiving her first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech). She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and found to have a positive HIT screen with optical density (OD) of 0.6 via ELISA test. She was hospitalized for 4 days and discharged home with an oral anticoagulant (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSIONS This case report describes a possible link between BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination and thromboembolism. However, further data are needed to support such an association."
COVID-19 vaccines: progress and understanding on quality control and evaluation.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to global health and economy. Countermeasures have revolutionized norms for working, socializing, learning, and travel. Importantly, vaccines have been considered as most effective tools to combat with COVID-19. As of the beginning of 2021, >200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates, covering nearly all existing technologies and platforms, are being research and development (R&D) by multiple manufacturers worldwide. This has posed a huge obstacle to the quality control and evaluation of those candidate vaccines, especially in China, where five vaccine platforms are deployed in parallel. To accelerate the R&D progress of COVID-19 vaccines, the guidances on R&D of COVID-19 vaccine have been issued by National Regulatory Authorities or organizations worldwide. The Center for Drug Evaluation and national quality control laboratory in China have played a leading role in launching the research on quality control and evaluation in collaboration with relevant laboratories involved in the vaccine R&D, which greatly supported the progression of vaccines R&D, and accelerated the approval for emergency use and conditional marketing of currently vaccine candidates. In this paper, the progress and experience gained in quality control and evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China are summarized, which might provide references for the R&D of current and next generation of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide."
The Longest Infectious Virus Shedding in a Child Infected With the G614 Strain of SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 spread globally and caused over 97 million cases with more than 2 million deaths. There is still ongoing discussion on the duration of infectious interval SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptomatic children had longer virus shedding and there are some reports of prolonged infectious virus shedding in adults particularly patients having an immunocompromised status. A missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe and is spreading worldwide that can result in higher viral loads in patients. Herein, we described the longest infectious virus shedding in a previously healthy child infected with SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike D614G substitution."
COVID-19: A review of therapeutic strategies and vaccine candidates.,"The world is engulfed by one of the most widespread and significant public health crises in decades as COVID-19 has become among the leading causes of death internationally. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has unified the scientific community in search of therapeutic and preventative solutions. The top priorities at the moment are twofold: first, to repurpose already-approved pharmacologic agents or develop novel therapies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the ever-spreading virus. Secondly, the scientific and larger pharmaceutical community have been tasked with the development, testing, and production of a safe and effective vaccine as a longer-term solution to prevent further spread and recurrence throughout the populace. The purpose of this article is to review the most up-to-date published data regarding both the leading pharmacological therapies undergoing clinical trials and vaccine candidates in development to stem the threat of COVID-19."
Current treatment approaches for COVID-19 and the clinical value of transfusion-related technologies.,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is a new enveloped virus that belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus. As a major health crisis, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a million people around the world. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been used in clinical practice. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and discusses the clinical value of blood transfusion-related technologies used in COVID-19 treatment."
"Widespread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmission Among Attendees at a Large Motorcycle Rally and their Contacts, 30 US Jurisdictions, August-September, 2020.","The 2020 Sturgis motorcycle rally resulted in widespread transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 across the United States. At least 649 coronavirus disease 2019 cases were identified, including secondary and tertiary spread to close contacts. To limit transmission, persons attending events should be vaccinated or wear masks and practice physical distancing if unvaccinated. Persons with a known exposure should be managed according to their coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination or prior infection status and may include quarantine and coronavirus disease 2019 testing."
[It's world war at CoViD-19. The first battle on the front of the viral invasion against the exitus for interstitial pneumonia was decisive.].,"An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus. The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress."
"COVID-19 autopsy reports from the Ga-East Municipal and the 37 Military Hospitals in Accra, Ghana.","Introduction: Since the declaration of COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a global pandemic on 11th March 2020, the number of deaths continue to increase worldwide. Reports on its pathologic manifestations have been published with very few from the Sub-Saharan African region. This article reports autopsies on COVID-19 patients from the Ga-East and the 37 Military Hospitals to provide pathological evidence for better understanding of COVID-19 in Ghana. Methods: Under conditions required for carrying out autopsies on bodies infected with category three infectious agents, with few modifications, complete autopsies were performed on twenty patients with ante-mortem and/or postmortem RT -PCR confirmed positive COVID-19 results, between April and June, 2020. Results: There were equal proportion of males and females. Thirteen (65%) of the patients were 55years or older with the same percentage (65%) having Type II diabetes and/or hypertension. The most significant pathological feature found at autopsy was diffuse alveolar damage. Seventy per cent (14/20) had associated thromboemboli in the lungs, kidneys and the heart. Forty per cent (6/15) of the patients that had negative results for COVID-19 by the nasopharyngeal swab test before death had positive results during postmortem using bronchopulmonary specimen. At autopsy all patients were identified to have pre-existing medical conditions. Conclusion: Diffuse alveolar damage was a key pathological feature of deaths caused by COVID-19 in all cases studied with hypertension and diabetes mellitus being major risk factors. Individuals without co-morbidities were less likely to die or suffer severe disease from SARS-CoV-2. Funding: None declared."
Scaling up COVID-19 rapid antigen tests: promises and challenges.,"WHO recommends a minimum of 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity for antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs), which can be used for patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. However, after the acute phase when viral load decreases, use of Ag-RDTs might lead to high rates of false negatives, suggesting that the tests should be replaced by a combination of molecular and serological tests. When the likelihood of having COVID-19 is low, such as for asymptomatic individuals in low prevalence settings, for travel, return to schools, workplaces, and mass gatherings, Ag-RDTs with high negative predictive values can be used with confidence to rule out infection. For those who test positive in low prevalence settings, the high false positive rate means that mitigation strategies, such as molecular testing to confirm positive results, are needed. Ag-RDTs, when used appropriately, are promising tools for scaling up testing and ensuring that patient management and public health measures can be implemented without delay."
May viral load detected in saliva in the early stages of infection be a prognostic indicator in COVID-19 patients?,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of viral load detected in the saliva of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of infection. Study design: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. Results: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56 % of patients had mild disease, 26.4 % had moderate disease, 9.6 % had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples' Ct-values (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. Conclusion: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old. Saliva is an easily obtainable, reliable material for COVID-19 screening."
A case report of COVID-19 with false negative RT-PCR test: necessity of chest CT.,"The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab. However, the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT. We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results."
"An outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in a secondary care hospital in Finland, May 2021.","An outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spread from one inpatient in a secondary care hospital to three primary care facilities, resulting in 58 infections including 18 deaths in patients and 45 infections in healthcare workers (HCW). Only one of the deceased cases was fully vaccinated. Transmission occurred despite the use of personal protective equipment by the HCW, as advised in national guidelines, and a high two-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage among permanent staff members in the COVID-19 cohort ward."
Co-infections among patients with COVID-19: The need for combination therapy with non-anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents?,"Co-infection has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but there is limited knowledge on co-infection among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."
A Role for Extracellular Vesicles in SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics and Prevention.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the common designation for ectosomes, microparticles and microvesicles serving dominant roles in intercellular communication. Both viable and dying cells release EVs to the extracellular environment for transfer of cell, immune and infectious materials. Defined morphologically as lipid bi-layered structures EVs show molecular, biochemical, distribution, and entry mechanisms similar to viruses within cells and tissues. In recent years their functional capacities have been harnessed to deliver biomolecules and drugs and immunological agents to specific cells and organs of interest or disease. Interest in EVs as putative vaccines or drug delivery vehicles are substantial. The vesicles have properties of receptors nanoassembly on their surface. EVs can interact with specific immunocytes that include antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells and other mononuclear phagocytes) to elicit immune responses or affect tissue and cellular homeostasis or disease. Due to potential advantages like biocompatibility, biodegradation and efficient immune activation, EVs have gained attraction for the development of treatment or a vaccine system against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection. In this review efforts to use EVs to contain SARS CoV-2 and affect the current viral pandemic are discussed. An emphasis is made on mesenchymal stem cell derived EVs' as a vaccine candidate delivery system."
"Rapid Emergence and Epidemiologic Characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 Variant - New York City, New York, January 1-April 5, 2021.","Recent studies have documented the emergence and rapid growth of B.1.526, a novel variant of interest (VOI) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the New York City (NYC) area after its identification in NYC in November 2020 (1-3). Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection. Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts."
Resistance to COVID-19 vaccination has increased in Ireland and the United Kingdom during the pandemic.,"Objectives: Hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination poses a serious challenge to achieving adequate vaccine uptake in the general population. Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. Study design: This is a quantitative, longitudinal design. Method: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. Results: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (from 6.2% to 10%) adults. Conclusion: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed. Growing resistance to COVID-19 vaccination will pose a challenge to public health officials responsible for ensuring sufficient vaccine coverage."
"COVID-19: Antiviral Agents, Antibody Development and Traditional Chinese Medicine.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic caused by coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug approved worldwide for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Therapeutic options in response to the COVID-19 outbreak are urgently needed. To facilitate the better and faster development of therapeutic COVID-19 drugs, we present an overview of the global promising therapeutic drugs, including repurposing existing antiviral agents, network-based pharmacology research, antibody development and traditional Chinese medicine. Among all these drugs, we focus on the most promising drugs (such as favipiravir, tocilizumab, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, Lianhua Qingwen, interferon beta-1a, remdesivir, etc.) that have or will enter the final stage of human testing-phase III-IV clinical trials."
Health inequities in COVID-19 vaccination among the elderly: Case of Connecticut.,"Background: In the United States, distribution plans for the COVID-19 vaccination were established at the state level. However, some states, such as Connecticut, followed an age-based strategy without considering occupations or co-morbid conditions due to its simplicity in implementation. This strategy raised concerns about exacerbating health inequities because it did not prioritize vulnerable communities, specifically, minorities and low-income groups. The study aims to examine the vaccination inequities among different population groups for people aged 65+. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of quantile-based independent sample t-test was employed to examine the relationship between eight social vulnerability indices (SVIs, i.e., below poverty, unemployed, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, no vehicle, and mobile homes) and vaccination rates at the town level in Connecticut during the second phase of the vaccine distribution plan when individuals aged 65 and over were eligible. Negative binomial regressions were employed to further justify the relationships between SVIs and vaccination rates. Results: The report shows that the differences in vaccination rates were statistically significant between the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable towns with respect to six SVIs (i.e., below poverty, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, and no vehicle). The vaccination gap was greater for people aged 75+ than people aged 65-74. Among the selected SVIs, below poverty was negatively correlated with the vaccination rate for 75+, and without high school diploma was negatively correlated with both rates. Conclusions: This report reveals the significant health inequities in COVID-19 vaccination among the elderly population at the early vaccination phase. It can shed insights into health policy initiatives to improve vaccination coverage in the elderly communities, such as promoting onsite scheduling and increasing at-home vaccination services."
"SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in Italy, in early December 2019.","Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identified in China, in December 2019 determines COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19). Whether or not the virus was present in Italy earlier the first autochthonous COVID-19 case was diagnosed is still uncertain. We aimed to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera collected from 4th November 2019 to 9th March 2020, in order to assess the possible spread of the virus in Italy earlier than the first official national diagnosis. Patients and methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated in retrospective serum samples from 234 patients with liver diseases (Hep-patients) and from 56 blood donors (BDs). We used two rapid serologic tests which were confirmed by a validated chemoluminescence assay. Results: Via rapid tests, we found 10/234 (4.3%) IgG-positive and 1/234 (0.4%) IgM-positive cases in the Hep-patient group. Two/56 (3.6%) IgG-positive and 2/56 (3.6%) IgM-positive cases were detected in BD group. Chemoluminescence confirmed IgG-positivity in 3 Hep-patients and 1 BD and IgM-positivity in 1 Hep-patient. RNAemia was not detected in any of the subjects, rendering the risk of transfusion transmission negligible. Conclusions: Our results suggest an early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, before the first COVID-19 cases were described in China. Rapid tests have multiple benefits; however, a confirmation assay is required to avoid false positive results."
"In Vitro and In Vivo Models for Studying SARS-CoV-2, the Etiological Agent Responsible for COVID-19 Pandemic.","The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the scientific community to rapidly develop in vitro and in vivo models that could be applied in COVID-19 research. In vitro models include two-dimensional (2D) cultures of immortalized cell lines or primary cells and three-dimensional (3D) cultures derived from lung, alveoli, bronchi, and other organs. Although cell-based systems are economic and allow strict control of experimental variables, they do not always resemble physiological conditions. Thus, several in vivo models are being developed, including different strains of mice, hamsters, ferrets, dogs, cats, and non-human primates. In this review, we summarize the main models of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed so far and discuss their advantages, drawbacks and main uses."
Out of Africa: A Solidarity-Based Approach to Vaccine Allocation.,"This article sets forth a solidaristic approach to global distribution of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our approach draws inspiration from African ethics and from the characterization of the Covid-19 crisis as a syndemic, a convergence of biosocial forces that interact with one another to produce and exacerbate clinical disease and prognosis. The first section elaborates the twin ideas of syndemic and solidarity. The second section argues that these ideas lend support to global health alliances to distribute vaccines beyond national borders. The third section introduces ethical criteria to guide global distribution, emphasizing priority to low- and middle-income countries, which have the least ability to obtain vaccines on their own. It also justifies giving priority to people at high risk of infection and high risk of severe disease and death."
Responsible Return to Essential and Non-Essential Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Non-essential surgery had largely been suspended during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Enormous amounts of resources were utilized to shift surgical practices to a ""disaster footing"" with most elective surgeons assuming new roles to offset the anticipated burden from surgical and medical personnel delivering acute care. As the number of COVID-19-infected patients began to plateau in the state of Ohio, a four-phase ""Responsible Return to Surgery"" approach was adopted in concert with the Ohio Department of Health and the Ohio Hospital Association. This approach was adopted understanding that a simple return to the status quo prior to the COVID-19 pandemic might be harmful to patients, providers, and staff. The discrete phases undertaken at our quaternary care institution for a responsible return to non-essential surgery are outlined with the goal of ensuring timely care, minimizing community transmission, and preserving personal protective equipment. Operationalizing these phases relied upon the widespread use of telehealth, systematic COVID-19 testing, and real-time monitoring of hospital and personal protective equipment resources."
Willingness to Vaccinate Against COVID-19 in the U.S.: Representative Longitudinal Evidence From April to October 2020.,"Introduction: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. Methods: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Results: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. Conclusions: Intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 have declined rapidly during the pandemic, and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated."
Immunoglobulin Response and Prognostic Factors in Repeated SARS-CoV-2 Positive Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"With repeated positivity being an undiscovered and major concern, we aimed to evaluate which prognostic factors may impact repeated SARS-CoV-2 positivity (RSP) and their association with immunoglobulin detectability among recovered patients. A systematic literature search was performed on 5 April 2021. Cohort studies with risk factors for repeated RSP or information about the immunoglobulin response (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG)) were included in this analysis. The main examined risk factors were severity of the initial infection, body mass index (BMI), length of hospitalization (LOH), age, and gender, for which we pooled mean differences and odds ratios (ORs). Thirty-four cohort studies (N = 9269) were included in our analysis. We found that increased RSP rate might be associated with IgG positivity; IgG presence was higher in RSP patients (OR: 1.72, CI: 0.87-3.41, p = 0.117). Among the examined risk factors, only mild initial disease course showed a significant association with RSP (OR: 0.3, CI: 0.14-0.67, p = 0.003). Age, male gender, BMI, LOH, and severity of the first episode do not seem to be linked with repeated positivity. However, further prospective follow-up studies focusing on this topic are required."
"Etiology and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses among children in Zhejiang Province, China 2017-2019.","Background: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerging has put global public health institutes on high alert. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses. Methods: From February 2017 to December 2019, 3660 respiratory samples submitted to Zhejiang Children Hospital with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for four human coronaviruses RNA by a novel two-tube multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Samples were also screened for the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Results: Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 144 (3.93%) specimens: HCoV-HKU1 in 38 specimens, HCoV-NL63 in 62 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 38 specimens and HCoV-229E in 8 specimens. Genomes for SARS-CoV-2 were absent in all specimens by RT-PCR analysis during the study period. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during fall months. No significant differences in gender, sample type, year were seen across species. 37.5 to 52.6% of coronaviruses detected were in specimens testing positive for other respiratory viruses. Phylogenic analysis identified that Zhejiang coronaviruses belong to multiple lineages of the coronaviruses circulating in other countries and areas. Conclusion: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in fall months in the Zhejiang province, China. Genetic relatedness to the coronaviruses in other regions suggests further surveillance on human coronaviruses in clinical samples are clearly needed to understand their patterns of activity and role in the emergence of novel coronaviruses."
Testing-on-a-probe biosensors reveal association of early SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies and surrogate neutralizing antibodies with mortality in COVID-19 patients.,"The association of mortality with the early humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection within the first few days after onset of symptoms (DAOS) has not been thoroughly investigated partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive antibody testing methods. Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality."
Renal transplantation after recovery from COVID-19 - a case report with implications for transplant programs in the face of the ongoing corona-pandemic.,"Background: The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has major impacts on both patients and healthcare systems worldwide, thus creating new realities. Patients on maintenance dialysis listed for renal transplantation are a vulnerable subgroup with many comorbidities and recurring contacts with the healthcare system. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic transplant numbers have dropped considerably, further increasing waiting times in this high-risk population. On the other hand, knowledge of the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients, development and persistence of neutralising antibodies in such patients is just emerging. It is unclear how best to address the dilemma of postponing the life-saving transplantation. Case presentation: We present a case report of a successful kidney transplantation only 65 days after the recipient was hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. In a follow up of 9 months, we observed no signs of recurrent disease and transplant function is excellent. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody response demonstrates stable IgG levels. Conclusion: This reassuring case provides guidance to transplant centers how to proceed with kidney transplantation safely during the pandemic. Careful consideration of risks and benefits of the organ offer, full recovery from COVID-19 symptoms and the presence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test, qualifies for kidney transplantation."
Science and religion for COVID-19 vaccine promotion.,"A recent correspondence published in this journal proposed a multi-sectoral approach on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination hesitancy, whereas another proposed that religious leaders play a role in gaining the public's trust in COVID-19 vaccine. This article raises awareness that though religious leaders play a huge role in promoting the COVID-19 vaccine, they are still bound by the findings of science. What this article, therefore, proposes is the collaboration of science and religion in COVID-19 vaccine promotion."
"COVID-19 vaccine development during pandemic: gap analysis, opportunities, and impact on future emerging infectious disease development strategies.","The world remains cautiously optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine that is relatively safe and efficacious and that offers sufficient long-lasting protection/immunity by neutralizing the virus infectivity. However, key technical hurdles pertaining to antigen-adjuvant formulation, delivery, and manufacturing challenges of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for mRNA vaccines and stability of formulations need to be addressed for successful product development and stockpiling. In addition, the dosage form, the dosage level and regimen for eliciting a protective immune response remain to be established. The high dependence of global supply chains and demand-supply to sourcing quality raw materials, glassware and other supplies, along with the stress on existing production capacities and platform-specific manufacturing challenges could impede vaccine development and access. This article provides critical analysis of vaccine development processes and unit operations that can derail the pandemic response, and also extends to other emerging infectious disease development efforts - issues that take on added significance given the global mandate for an accelerated and at-risk development path to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic."
An overview of COVID-19.,"Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus. We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic."
Coronavirus disease 2019 in children.,"Purpose of review: Over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has become clear that the clinical features, epidemiology, and outcomes of COVID-19 are distinct in children relative to adults. In this review, we will present recent pediatric studies informing our current understanding of COVID-19 in children, and review pediatric considerations surrounding disease transmission, currently available therapies, and vaccination. Recent findings: Recent studies have shed light on the clinical epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children, identifying a high prevalence of asymptomatic and mild infections, with severe COVID-19 infrequently reported. Several adult clinical trials have informed the use of remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, and tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19. Associations between underlying comorbid medical conditions and severe outcomes, as well as transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in children, are complex and warrant further study. Finally, highly efficacious vaccines are available for adults and adolescents, with pediatric trials ongoing. Summary: Children generally fare well with acute COVID-19 infection, though critical illness is possible. Future research should focus on clarifying the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and optimal prevention strategies, particularly in the school setting, as well as evaluating pediatric vaccine candidates."
Factors associated with high compliance behaviour against COVID-19 in the early phase of pandemic: a cross-sectional study in 12 Asian countries.,"Introduction: Regardless of having effective vaccines against COVID-19, containment measures such as enhanced physical distancing and good practice of personal hygiene remain the mainstay of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries across Asia have imposed these containment measures to varying extents. However, residents in different countries would have a differing degree of compliance to these containment measures potentially due to differences in the level of awareness and motivation in the early phase of pandemic. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to describe and correlate the level of knowledge and attitude with the level of compliance with personal hygiene and physical distancing practices among Asian countries in the early phase of pandemic. Methods: A multinational cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May and June 2020 across 14 geographical areas. Subjects aged 21 years and above were invited to participate through social media, word of mouth and electronic mail. Results: Among the 2574 responses obtained, 762 (29.6%) participants were from East Asia and 1812 (70.4%) were from Southeast Asia (SEA). A greater proportion of participants from SEA will practise physical distancing as long as it takes (72.8% vs 60.6%). Having safe distancing practices such as standing more than 1 or 2 m apart (AdjOR 5.09 95% CI (1.08 to 24.01)) or more than 3 or 4 m apart (AdjOR 7.05 95% CI (1.32 to 37.67)), wearing a mask when they had influenza-like symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic, preferring online news channels such as online news websites/applications (AdjOR 1.73 95% CI (1.21 to 2.49)) and social media (AdjOR 1.68 95% CI (1.13 to 2.50) as sources of obtaining information about COVID-19 and high psychological well-being (AdjOR 1.39 95% CI (1.04 to 1.87)) were independent factors associated with high compliance. Conclusions: We found factors associated with high compliance behaviour against COVID-19 in the early phase of pandemic and it will be useful to consider them in risk assessment, communication and pandemic preparedness."
Challenges in COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Objective: In this narrative review, our aim was to clarify the roles of diagnostic methods used in COVID-19 disease. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirusis emerged as the major healthcare challenge globally. The mainstay approach to limit this virus spread is an early and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection and appropriate quarantine of patients with coronavirus infection. Results: Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a quick detection of the disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In literature, there are numerous studies that underline the importance of CT as the first-step diagnostic tool in COVID-19 diagnosis. Even in asymptomatic patients, COVID-19 pneumonia may manifest with chest CT imaging abnormalities. Conclusion: There is a need for an algorithm, which involves a combination of PCR and CT in diagnosis of COVID-19 (Ref. 85)."
Validation of a direct-to-PCR COVID-19 detection protocol utilizing mechanical homogenization: A model for reducing resources needed for accurate testing.,"Efficient and effective viral detection methodologies are a critical piece in the global response to COVID-19, with PCR-based nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing serving as the current gold standard. With over 100 million confirmed cases globally, the supply chains supporting these PCR testing efforts are under a tremendous amount of stress, driving the need for innovative and accurate diagnostic solutions. Herein, the utility of a direct-to-PCR method of SARS-CoV-2 detection grounded in mechanical homogenization is examined for reducing resources needed for testing while maintaining a comparable sensitivity to the current gold standard workflow of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing. In a head-to-head comparison of 30 patient samples, this initial clinical validation study of the proposed homogenization-based workflow demonstrated significant agreeability with the current extraction-based method utilized while cutting the total resources needed in half."
COVID-19 vaccines: A perspective from social pharmacology.,"Social pharmacology is a branch of clinical pharmacology, which depicts relationships between society and drugs and in particular factors, reasons, social consequences of drug use as well as representations of drugs in the society. Recent development and marketing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines raises a number of questions of social pharmacology: are vaccines drugs like any other? What is their perception at the individual, population and societal levels? How do individuals perceive the risks and benefits of these vaccines? What is the perception at the societal level? What is the individual and societal acceptability of these vaccines during a pandemic? All these questions are discussed in the light of recent data. A number of proposals, both at the individual and at the collective or population level, are formulated to help solve these problems of social pharmacology."
Higher viral loads in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients might be the invisible part of the iceberg.,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics in different hosts and different samples and their relationship with disease severity have not been clearly revealed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Methods: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory. Results: A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load."
SARS-CoV-2 variants evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and effects of mutations on adaptation in Wuhan populations.,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic apparently started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since affected many countries worldwide, turning into a major global threat. Chinese researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be classified into two major variants. They suggest that investigating the variations and characteristics of these variants might help assess risks and develop better treatment and prevention strategies. The two variants were named L-type and S-type, in which L-type was prevailed in an initial outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, and S-type was phylogenetically older than L-type and less prevalent at an early stage, but with a later increase in frequency in Wuhan. There were 149 mutations in 103 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, 83 of which were nonsynonymous, leading to alteration in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Much effort is currently being devoted to elucidate whether or not these mutations affect viral transmissibility and virulence. In this review, we summarize the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of virus evolution and discuss the significance of the gene alterations in infections."
An Overview of Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Macau S.A.R.,"The Greater Bay Area of southern China has a population of over 71 million people. The area is well-connected with Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Macau, as the most densely populated city in the world, is very vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. Since its return to the sovereignty of China 20 years ago, the city has experienced outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Swine flu, and COVID-19. At the time of writing, 10 confirmed imported/local transmission cases were recorded. The government undertook measures to attain and then maintain 40 days without new cases. In this article, we report on the 10 confirmed cases and discuss the measures that the Macau Special Administrative Region (S.A.R.) government undertook during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Ending the Pandemic: Are Rapid COVID-19 Tests a Step Forward or Back?,"Some experts have promoted the use of rapid testing for COVID-19. However, with the current technologies available, continuing to replace laboratory-based, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests with rapid (point-of-care) tests may lead to an increased number of false negative tests. Moreover, the more rapid dissemination of false negative results that can occur with the use of rapid tests for COVID-19 may lead to increased spread of the novel coronavirus if patients do not understand the concept of false negative tests. One means of combatting this would be to tell patients who have a ""negative"" rapid COVID-19 test that their test result was ""indeterminate."""
Elucidating reasons of COVID-19 re-infection and its management strategies.,"Background and aims: Reinfection is gradually being recognised after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. We try to elucidate various explanations behind COVID-19 reinfection and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. Methods: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Reinfection', 'Vaccines' and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in March 2021 and first half of April 2021 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiology, risk factors and trends of reinfection were assessed. Results: A multitude of factors have been associated with rising incidence of COVID-19 reinfection in India and across the world. Emergence of 'Variants of Concern (VOC)', pandemic fatigue and disregard of infection prevention strategies appear to be the most obvious reasons. Conclusions: COVID-19 reinfection is an emerging concern amongst the worldwide population with newer mutant strains demonstrating increasing transmissibility and responsible for continuing waves of the pandemic. COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), improvised vaccines and enhanced vaccination drives are necessary to mitigate global threat."
Emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage VUI-NP13L and massive spread of P.2 in South Brazil.,"In this study, we analyzed 340 whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which were sampled between April and November 2020 in 33 cities of Rio Grande do Sul, South Brazil. We demonstrated the circulation of two novel emergent lineages, VUI-NP13L and VUI-NP13L-like, and five major lineages that had already been assigned (B.1.1.33, B.1.1.28, P.2, B.1.91, B.1.195). P.2 and VUI-NP13L demonstrated a massive spread in October 2020. Constant and consistent genomic surveillance is crucial to identify newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and to guide decision making in the Brazilian Public Healthcare System."
Coronavirus disease 2019 and the revival of passive immunization: Antibody therapy for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and preventing host cell infection: IUPHAR review: 31.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stimulated both the scientific community and healthcare companies to undertake an unprecedented effort with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and developing effective therapeutic solutions. The peculiar immune response triggered by this virus, which seems to last only few months, led to a search for alternatives such as passive immunization in addition to conventional vaccinations. Convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies selected from the most potent neutralizing binders induced by the virus infection, recombinant human single-domain antibodies, and binders of variable scaffold and different origin have been tested alone or in combination exploiting monovalent, multivalent and multispecific formats. In this review, we analyse the state of the research in this field and present a summary of the ongoing projects finalized to identify suitable molecules for therapies based on passive immunization."
Zoonotic and Reverse Zoonotic Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appears to be capable of infecting different mammalian species. Recent detections of this virus in pet, zoo, wild, and farm animals have compelled inquiry regarding the zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of COVID-19 pandemic evolving into a panzootic. It is important to monitor the global spread of disease and to assess the significance of genomic changes to support prevention and control efforts during a pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology provides opportunities to prevent the risk of repeated re-infection of humans and requires a robust One Health-based investigation. This review paper describes the known properties and the existing gaps in scientific knowledge about the zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmissibility of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes."
Consensus statement on coronary intervention during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic: from the Korean Society of Interventional Cardiology.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The first case developed in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China; several months later, COVID-19 has become pandemic, and there is no end in sight. This disaster is also causing serious health problems in the area of cardiovascular intervention. In response, the Korean Society of Interventional Cardiology formed a COVID-19 task force to develop practice guidelines. This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within facilities; the guidelines were developed to protect patients and healthcare workers from this highly contagious virus. We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and cardiovascular disease patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Leaving no stone unturned in light of the COVID-19 faecal-oral hypothesis? A water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) perspective targeting low-income countries.","The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19. Future research directions on COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission are highlighted."

The first includes twelve personal stories from IRB members, administrators, or staff about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second section includes twelve personal stories from researchers. Six commentaries on these narratives are offered by experts in research ethics, regulatory oversite, IRB administration, the logistics of clinical research, and investigator responsibilities. These narratives and commentaries offer an inside look at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the physical logistics of clinical research already underway, demanded immediate investment in scientific investigation of vaccines and treatments, and rerouted the usual decision pathways that guide ethical practice."
"Rapid and sensitive diagnostic procedure for multiple detection of pandemic Coronaviridae family members SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV: a translational research and cooperation between the Phan Chau Trinh University in Vietnam and University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"" in Italy.","Objective: A new pandemic coronavirus causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), initially called 2019-nCoV and successively named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. Patients and methods: The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Results: Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound. Conclusions: This translational diagnostic tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2."
Can symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia be diagnostic for COVID-19?,"Objective: Olfactory and taste dysfunction (OTD) is a potential neurological manifestation of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia for COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from 1 June 2020 to 12 June 2020. All studies reporting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19-positive patients were included. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review. Results: Symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia were frequently reported by COVID-19-positive patients. Symptoms were more common in females and in younger patients. There was no direct association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of symptoms. However, some evidence was found for a longer duration of these symptoms and increased severity of COVID-19 infection in young patients. Conclusion: OTD is commonly reported by COVID-19 patients. Due to limited literature on the association between OTD and COVID-19, it is currently not possible to conclude that these symptoms alone can be used to diagnose COVID-19. However, the presence of OTD can potentially be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 especially in young and female patients. Further research is required to establish the true diagnostic value of these symptoms and efficacy as screening tools for COVID-19 patients."
Wisely choosing the numbers during the pandemic.,"Having the right data is critical in managing a crisis. More so, at the time of a pandemic. Rather than relying heavily on absolute numbers, we discuss alternatives that could improve testing numbers in India."
Herd immunization with childhood vaccination may provide protection against COVID-19.,"It may take time to obtain a vaccine for the current COVID-19, and the virus genome may keep an evolution and mutations, so a universal and effective vaccine for the coronavirus may not be possible. Epidemiological studies reveal the infection of SARS and COVID-19 in children is less frequent and less severe than in adults. Childhood vaccine-mediated cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation might provide protection against the infections of COVID-19. These data suggest that herd immunization with children vaccines in adults may improve the adult cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation and improve their clinical presentation and prognosis. This can be also useful to cope with future pandemics."
Exploring SARS-COV-2 structural proteins to design a multi-epitope vaccine using immunoinformatics approach: An in silico study.,"In December 2019, a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 was reported in China and quickly spread to other parts of the world. The development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines has recently received much attention from numerous researchers. The present study aims to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-COV-2 using the reverse vaccinology method. In this regard, structural proteins from SARS-COV-2, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were selected as target antigens for epitope prediction. A total of five helper T lymphocytes (HTL) and five cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes were selected after screening the predicted epitopes for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Subsequently, the selected HTL and CTL epitopes were fused via flexible linkers. Next, the cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) as an adjuvant was linked to the N-terminal of the chimeric structure. The proposed vaccine was analyzed for the properties of physicochemical, antigenicity, and allergenicity. The 3D model of the vaccine construct was predicted and docked with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to evaluate the stable interactions between the vaccine construct and TLR4. The immune simulation was also conducted to explore the immune responses induced by the vaccine. Finally, in silico cloning of the vaccine construct into the pET-28 (+) vector was conducted. The results obtained from all bioinformatics analysis stages were satisfactory; however, in vitro and in vivo tests are essential to validate these results."
The case of a liver-transplant recipient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who had a favorable outcome.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in 2019; thereafter, the COVID-19 outbreak became a health emergency of international concern. The impact of COVID-19 on liver-transplant recipients is unclear. Thus, it is currently unknown whether liver-transplant recipients are at a higher risk of developing complications related to COVID-19. Here, we report the case of liver-transplant recipients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. A 20-year-old man who had undergone living-donor liver transplantation from his father at 5 years of age because of congenital biliary atresia was referred to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest computed tomography did not show any abnormalities; however, laboratory results revealed liver dysfunction. He received tacrolimus as maintenance therapy that was continued at the same dose. He has not developed severe pulmonary disease and was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Limited data are available on post-transplant patients with COVID-19, and this case of a young patient without metabolic comorbidities did not show any association of severe COVID-19 under tacrolimus treatment. The progression of COVID-19 in liver-transplant recipients is complex, and COVID-19 risk should be evaluated in each patient until the establishment of optimal guidelines."
Anesthesiologist behavior and anesthesia machine use in the operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic: awareness and changes to cope with the risk of infection transmission.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection] first appeared in December 2019 in China and is now spreading worldwide. Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via aerosols and surface contaminations of the environment, appropriate use of anesthesia machines and appropriate behavior in the operation room (OR) are required specifically in relation to this disease. The use of high-performance hydrophobic filters with a high rate of virus rejection is recommended as the type of viral filter, and surgical team behaviors that result in aerosol splashes should be avoided. Appropriate hand hygiene by the anesthesiologist is crucial to prevent unexpected environmental contamination. When the anesthesia machine is used instead of an intensive care unit ventilator, it is important to keep the fresh gas flow at least equal to the minute ventilation to prevent excessive humidity in the circuit and to monitor condensation in the circuit and inspiratory carbon dioxide pressure. In addition, both the surgical smoke inherent in thermal tissue destruction and the surgical team's shoe soles may be factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room. Ensuring social distancing-even with a mask in the OR-may be beneficial because healthcare providers may be asymptomatic carriers. After the acute crisis period of COVID-19, the number of cases of essential but nonurgent surgeries for waiting patients is likely to increase; therefore, optimization of OR scheduling will be an important topic. Anesthesiologists will benefit from new standard practices focusing on the prevention of COVID-19 infection."
Perspectives on therapeutic neutralizing antibodies against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority."
"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 3 (Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020).","This is the third epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), from the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 15 February 2020. It includes data on the COVID-19 Australian cases, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread."
Long-term antibody persistence and exceptional vaccination response on previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.,"Background: The first COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed to the general population. However, the shortage of doses is slowing down the goal of reaching herd immunity. The aim of the study was to verify whether previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, a considerable portion of the population, should receive the same vaccination treatment of seronegative individuals. Methods: Health-professionals either recovered from COVID-19 or never infected by SARS-CoV-2 were serologically tested at different time-points right before, and several days after, vaccination. Results: Previously infected individuals showed humoral immune responses, 21 days after the first dose, that was approximately 10-folds higher than the seronegative group 21 days after the second dose. Seropositivity persists for at least 11 months. Conclusion: During a shortage of COVID-19 vaccine doses, previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals should be dispensed from the vaccination campaign. When dose availability returns to normality, injection of a single dose for seropositive individuals should be considered."
Mutation-Specific SARS-CoV-2 PCR Screen: Rapid and Accurate Detection of Variants of Concern and the Identification of a Newly Emerging Variant with Spike L452R Mutation.,"The emergence of more transmissible and/or more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC) has triggered intensive genomic surveillance, which is costly and difficult to sustain operationally over the long term. To address this problem, we developed a set of four multiplex mutation-specific PCR-based assays with same-day reporting that can detect five VOC and three variants of interest (VOI), as defined in the March 2021 guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/). The screening results were compared to the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and showed 100% concordance for strain typing for B.1.1.7 (n = 25) and P.1 (n = 5) variants using spike (S) mutation S-N501Y, S-E484K, and S-H69-V70del assays. The S-L450R assay, designed to detect the B.1.427/429 VOC, also identified multiple isolates of a newly emerging multiply mutated B.1.526.1 variant that is now rapidly increasing in the eastern United States. PCR approaches can be easily adopted in clinical laboratories, providing rapid screening methods to allow early detection of newly emergent variants and to efficiently triage cases for full genomic sequencing."
"Point-of-care rapid antigen testing for COVID-19 at a tertiary eye care facility: Role in commencement of elective surgeries, contact tracing and implementation of back-to-work policy.","Purpose: The aim of this study was to report the use and the impact of a point-of-care rapid antigen test (PoC-RAT) at a tertiary eye care facility in facilitating commencement of elective surgeries, contact tracing of exposed health care professionals (HCPs) and ancillary hospital staff, and implementation of back-to-work (BTW) policy for them. Methods: Retrospective analysis of subjects undergoing PoC-RAT for COVID-19 infection at a tertiary level dedicated eye care facility. Decision making with regard to commencement of elective surgeries post COVID-19 related discontinuation of services, contact tracing of HCPs and ancillary hospital staff exposed to known COVID-19 cases and implementation of back-to-work policy for all staff based upon the results of PoC-RAT were studied. Results: A total of 311 subjects (224 patients and 87 hospital staff) were tested. Overall positivity rate was around 7%. Asymptomatic patients who were screened preoperatively had a lower positivity rate at around 3% compared to the staff (who were either known contacts or were symptomatic) at around 17%. Contact tracing found three-quarters of the staff at low risk and only one quarter at medium or high risk. Among patients, 97% of those followed up for at least 2 weeks after the test remained healthy. For staff, this was around 65%. Conclusion: Based on our preliminary results, we suggest that PoC-RAT may be considered routinely for indication-based preoperative screening of asymptomatic patients, and for on-campus screening, contact tracing and implementation of BTW policies for HCPs and ancillary hospital staff at a tertiary level eye care facility."
Synthesis and immunological evaluation of synthetic peptide based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.,"For prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, an effective vaccine is critical. Herein, several potential peptide epitopes from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been synthesized and covalently linked with the cross-reactive material (CRM197). Immunization of mice with the resulting conjugates induced high titers of IgG antibodies against the spike protein. Importantly, the post-immune sera effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, suggesting the epitopes identified are protective, and these conjugates are promising leads for anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development."
Immune response scenario and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"COVID-19 pandemic has started in December 2019 in China and quickly extended to become a worldwide health and economic emergency issue. It is caused by the novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients' clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic infection or flu like symptoms to serious pneumonia which could be associated with multiple organ failure possibly leading to death. It is understood that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 includes all elements of the immune system which could altogether succeed in viral elimination and complete cure. Meanwhile, this immune response may also lead to disease progression and could be responsible for the patient's death. Many trials have been done recently to create therapies and vaccines against human coronavirus infections such as MERS or SARS, however, till now, there is some controversy about the effectiveness and safety of antiviral drugs and vaccines which have been developed to treat and prevent this disease and its management depends mainly on supportive care. The spike glycoprotein or protein S of SARS-CoV-2 is the main promoter that induces development of neutralizing antibodies; hence, many attempts of vaccines and antiviral drugs development have been designed to be directed specifically against this protein. While some of these attempts have been proved to be efficient in in vitro settings, only few of them have been proceeded to randomized animal trials and human studies which makes COVID-19 prevention an ongoing challenge. This review describes the natural immune response scenario during COVID-19 and the vaccines development trials to create efficient vaccines thus helping to build more effective approaches for prophylaxis and management."
Evaluating the efficiency of specimen (sample) pooling for real-time PCR based diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Purpose: This study is aims at evaluating the efficacy and sensitivity of specimen pooling for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus to determine the accuracy, resource savings, and identification of borderline positive cases without impacting the accuracy of the testing. Method: This study was conducted between August and October 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR on the samples from varying prevalence of rural population (non-hot spot) referred to COVID laboratory, in the first step, the samples were collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools were tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 were then de-convoluted and each sample was tested individually. Results: In the present study, we tested 1580 samples in 158 pools of 10 and 17,515 samples in 3503 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 11 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 11 pools (110 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 10 individual samples came positive. Among 5 samples pool, 164 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 164 pools (820 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 171 individual samples came positive. The pooled sample testing strategy saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76%-93% fewer tests in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. Conclusion: Pooled sample RT- PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the quality of outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early asymptomatic stages of COVID-19 infections."
Reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 with patient-collected swabs and saline gargles: A three-headed comparison on multiple molecular platforms.,"With increasing demands for SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as the shortages for testing supplies, collection devices, and trained healthcare workers (HCWs) to collect specimens, self-collection is an attractive prospect to reduce the need for HCWs and expenditure of personal protective equipment. Apart from the traditional nasopharyngeal swab used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, alternative specimens have been validated such as a combined swabs of the oropharynx and anterior nares (OP/N), or throat samples using saline gargles. Both the alternative specimen types are amenable to self-collection. Objectives. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity of HCW-collected (OP/N) swabs, self-collected OP/N swabs, and self-collected saline gargles. Among 38 individuals previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (or their close contacts), two self-collected specimen types (OP/N and saline gargles) were compared to HCW-collected OP/N swabs. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on three molecular assays: a laboratory-developed test (LDT), and two commercial assays on automated platforms: Cobas 6800 (Roche Diagnostics) and Panther (Hologic). The sensitivity of self-collected OP/N swabs was equivalent to healthcare worker (HCW)-collected OP/N swabs at 100.0 % [92.6%-100.0%] for all three molecular tests. The sensitivity of saline gargles was not significantly different than HCW-collected OP/N swabs, but varied slightly between instruments at 93.8 % [85.9%-93.8%] for the LDT, 96.8 % [88.6%-96.8%] for the Cobas assay, and 96.7 % [89.2%-96.9%] for the Panther assay. Overall, self-collection using OP/N swabs or saline gargles are reasonable alternatives to HCW-based collections for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could facilitate broader surveillance strategies."
"Willingness to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among healthcare workers in public institutions of Zhejiang Province, China.","This study aims to investigate healthcare workers' (HCWs) willingness to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Zhejiang and to discover the related influential factors. The survey was conducted in six regions of Zhejiang Province, China, and 13 hospitals and 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were incorporated into the survey research. Participants were healthcare workers and a total of 3726 questionnaires were collected online, of which 3634 (97.53%) were analyzed. The relationships between the factors and the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 were computed as odds ratios (ORs) by means of multi-factor non-conditional logistic regression analysis. Of the 3634 participants, 2874 (79.09%) HCWs expressed their willingness to get vaccinated if the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available. Respondents who were younger than 50 years (OR = 1.502, 95% CI: 1.047-2.154), those who believed that they were somewhat likely (OR = 1.658, 95% CI: 1.297-2.120) or likely (OR = 1.893, 95% CI: 1.334-2.684) to get infected by SARS-COV-2 and those with a positive attitude toward the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were more willing to get vaccinated. Furthermore, compared to doctors, nurses were more reluctant to get vaccinated. In addition, it was found that higher the education level, lower the willingness to get vaccinated. This study revealed that HCWs in Zhejiang Province had a high willingness to get vaccinated. Awareness about the vaccine's effectiveness and safety and the disease severity should be promoted among HCWs over 50 years of age and nurses to increase the willingness to get vaccinated."
Possible transmission of viruses from contaminated human feces and sewage: Implications for SARS-CoV-2.,"Humanity has experienced outbreaks by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003, Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, Ebola virus in 2014 and nowadays SARS-CoV-2. While clinicians seek for a vaccine to reduce the epidemic outbreak, environmental engineers need to understand consequence of virus entity in sewage given the reported persistency of viruses in human feces and sewage environments for more than days. Herein, we discuss about concerns associated with virus occurrence in human feces and sewage, with attention to the possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, based on the review of recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 as well as the previous pandemic events. Given the reported environmental stability of coronavirus, the feces- and sewage-derived transmission routes may be of importance to prevent unprecedented spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) particularly in developing countries. However, so far, limited number of studies detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 even in human feces, whereas a number of virus RNA copies were identified in both feces and sewage specimens. Therefore, uncertainty remains in the possibility of this transmission pathway, and further investigation is warranted in future studies, for example, by increasing the number of specimens, examining the effectiveness of methods for viral viability test, considering the patient medical history, and so forth."
Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide. Given scarce resources, nonlaboratory diagnostics are crucial. In this cross-sectional study, two-thirds of European patients with confirmed COVID-19 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, indicating the significance of these symptoms in early diagnostics."
Low COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Is Correlated with Conspiracy Beliefs among University Students in Jordan.,"Vaccination to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a promising measure to overcome the negative consequences of the pandemic. Since university students could be considered a knowledgeable group, this study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among this group in Jordan. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. We used an online survey conducted in January 2021 with a chain-referral sampling approach. Conspiracy beliefs were evaluated using the validated Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores implying embrace of conspiracies. A total of 1106 respondents completed the survey with female predominance (n = 802, 72.5%). The intention to get COVID-19 vaccines was low: 34.9% (yes) compared to 39.6% (no) and 25.5% (maybe). Higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were seen among males (42.1%) and students at Health Schools (43.5%). A Low rate of influenza vaccine acceptance was seen as well (28.8%), in addition to 18.6% of respondents being anti-vaccination altogether. A significantly higher VCBS score was correlated with reluctance to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Dependence on social media platforms was significantly associated with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (19.8%) compared to dependence on medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals (47.2%, p < 0.001). The results of this study showed the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with conspiracy beliefs among university students in Jordan. The implementation of targeted actions to increase the awareness of such a group is highly recommended. This includes educational programs to dismantle vaccine conspiracy beliefs and awareness campaigns to build recognition of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines."
Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 8000 U.S. first-time convalescent plasma donations.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals carry antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that, through a plasma donation, can be used as a potential therapeutic either in direct transfusion or for the manufacture of hyperimmune globulin (HIG). The success of such interventions depends on the antibody potency in such plasma donations, but little information on the collection of potent units is currently available. Study design and methods: A total of 8749 plasma units, collected from April until September 2020 from first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, were characterized for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The period between COVID-19 onset until donation and donor age, ethnicity, sex, and COVID-19 severity were evaluated against the obtained signal (index S/C). Results: A marked decrease in mean index S/C was seen over the plasma collection period surveyed, which was significantly correlated to decreases in mean plasma donor age (p < .0001; R2 = .726) and percentage of donations obtained from COVID-19 convalescent patients who had been hospitalized (p = .001; R2 = .4426). The highest titer plasma units were obtained soon after convalescence from COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization, from advanced age donors, and from Black/African/Hispanic American versus White/Caucasian ethnicities, whereas there was no effect of donor sex on the values obtained with the Abbott CMIA. Conclusion: Since the onset of the pandemic, the average SARS-CoV-2 IgG values of first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations have significantly dropped, mainly due to donations from progressively younger aged donors who tend to experience less severe COVID-19."
SARS-CoV-2: Combating Coronavirus Emergence.,"The emergence and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 mark the third such identification of a novel coronavirus capable of causing severe, potentially fatal disease in humans in the 21st century. As noted by Andersen et al. (Nature Medicine), the sequencing of proximal zoonotic ancestors to SARS-CoV-2 has aided in the identification of alleles that may contribute to the virus' virulence in humans."
Active Covid-19 infection and transmission after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in Saudi Arabia: A case report.,"A 47-year-old non-smoker male who has received the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. At day 3 post-vaccination, he tested negative for Covid-19 and travelled to Egypt. On day 12 he developed runny nose, body ache and fever, and he reportedly tested (PCR) negative for Covid-19 Upon his return to Saudi on day 15, his symptoms have worsened and he presented to the Emergency Department, at which he tested positive for Covid-19. The patient was overweight (BMI = 29), was not suffering from any comorbidities and was not taking any medication. Upon examination, he was vitally stable and his laboratory investigation only revealed a slightly increased Creatinine. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. His condition did not require hospital admission, so he was discharged and advised to home-isolate himself. Four days after his discharge, his entire household came to the hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the first case report, in Saudi Arabia, of a person receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine and got infected with Covid-19 afterwards. The report highlights the significance of receiving the second dose of the vaccine to be effective. It also demonstrates that those with a single dose mRNA vaccine, could get infected and transmit the infection."
Positivity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies among Korean Healthy Healthcare Workers 1 and 2 Weeks after Second Dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccination.,"The antibody titer of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was observed in 289 healthy healthcare workers who had completed the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Antibody tests were performed using both the automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and the chromatographic lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). All subjects had antibodies against the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 only one week after completing the vaccination, and the antibody titer became significantly higher after another week (P < 0.001). Since there was a large amount of antibody formation within two weeks after completion of vaccination, the less sensitive method, LFIA, also showed high sensitivity. There was no significant difference between whole blood and serum in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after vaccination. This is an early study of vaccinations among Koreans and is expected to contribute to the establishment of national guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination."
The challenge of COVID-19 for a Clinical Microbiology Department.,"Objectives: To quantify the workload and cost overload that the COVID-19 pandemic has meant for a Clinical Microbiology laboratory in a real-life scenario. Methods: We compared the number of samples received, their distribution, the human resources, and the budget of a Microbiology laboratory in the COVID pandemic (March-December 2020) with the same months of the previous year. Results: the total number of samples processed in the Clinical Microbiology laboratory in March to December 2020 increased 96.70% with respect to 2019 (from 246,060 to 483,993 samples), reflecting an increment of 127.50% when expressed as samples/1000 admissions (from 6057 to 13,780). The increase in workload was mainly at the expense of the virology (+2058%) and serology (+86%) areas. Despite additional personnel hiring, the samples processed per technician increased 12.5%. The extra cost attributed to Microbiology amounts to 6,616,511 euros (114.8%). Conclusions: This is the first study to provide quantitative figures about workload and cost increase caused by the COVID-19 in a Microbiology laboratory."
Topical Oral and Intranasal Antiviral Agents for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"With the largest viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present in the oral and nasal cavities, agents that act on these two areas have the potential for large therapeutic and prophylactic benefit. A literature review was conducted to elucidate the possible agents useful in treatment of SARS-CoV-2. These agents were evaluated for their current applications, adverse reactions, their current state of study, and any future considerations in their management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Our review has found that, while there are many promising agents with proven efficacy in their in-vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, more clinical trials and in-vivo studies, as well as safety trials, must be conducted before these agents can be effectively implemented."
Performance assessment of 11 commercial serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalised COVID-19 patients.,"Background: Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Thorough validation of these tests is important before use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Methods: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. Results: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation. Conclusions: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population seroprevalence studies."
Current scenario of COVID-19 vaccinations and immune response along with antibody titer in vaccinated inhabitants of different countries.,"The COVID-19 pandemic challenges have been only partially addressed so far. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herdimmunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed.Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1-4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development."
How Did We Get a COVID-19 Vaccine in Less Than 1 Year?,"The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines within an unprecedented short time needs to be followed by rapid vaccine uptake, in particular, in high-risk populations such as patients with cancer. It is important for the scientific research community and cancer physicians to convey the knowledge behind the COVID-19 vaccine development and contribute to build the required trust on their use."
"Medicinal Plants, Phytochemicals, and Herbs to Combat Viral Pathogens Including SARS-CoV-2.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the most important health issue, internationally. With no specific and effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19, new or repurposed antiviral are urgently needed. Phytochemicals pose a ray of hope for human health during this pandemic, and a great deal of research is concentrated on it. Phytochemicals have been used as antiviral agents against several viruses since they could inhibit several viruses via different mechanisms of direct inhibition either at the viral entry point or the replication stages and via immunomodulation potentials. Recent evidence also suggests that some plants and its components have shown promising antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes certain phytochemical agents along with their mode of actions and potential antiviral activities against important viral pathogens. A special focus has been given on medicinal plants and their extracts as well as herbs which have shown promising results to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 as alternatives for treatment under phytotherapy approaches during this devastating pandemic situation."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Fecal Samples From Patients With Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19 in Korea.,"Background & aims: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, some patients have no or mild symptoms. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in feces of patients. We investigated gastrointestinal symptoms and shedding of virus into feces of patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Methods: We collected data from 46 patients (median age, 26 y; 46% men) with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (without fever and pneumonia) and prolonged respiratory shedding of SARS-CoV-2, quarantined from April 4, 2020, through April 24, 2020, in Korea. Respiratory specimens included upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory specimens (sputum), and were collected twice per week. The median interval between COVID-19 diagnosis to the start of fecal sample collection was 37 days (range, 29-41 d); 213 stool specimens were collected from 46 patients. We used real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory and fecal specimens. Results: Gastrointestinal manifestations were observed in 16 of the 46 patients (35%); diarrhea was the most common (15%), followed by abdominal pain (11%), dyspepsia (11%), and nausea (2%). Virus RNA was detected in feces from 2 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms (4%). Mean cycle threshold values from the time of quarantine to the time of fecal collection tended to be lower in patients with virus detected in fecal samples than in patients without virus in fecal samples (29.91 vs 33.67 in the first week, 29.47 vs 35.71 in the fifth week, respectively). Shedding of virus into feces persisted until day 50 after diagnosis; fecal samples began to test negative before or at approximately the time that respiratory specimens also began to test negative. Conclusions: In an analysis of fecal and respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 in quarantine in Korea, we found that the gastrointestinal tract could be a route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 even in patients with asymptomatic or mild disease, with no gastrointestinal symptoms. The viral load of the respiratory specimens appears be related to shedding of the virus into feces in this group of patients."
"COVID-19: Transmission, prevention, and potential therapeutic opportunities.","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global challenge. Despite intense research efforts worldwide, an effective vaccine and viable treatment options have eluded investigators. Therefore, infection prevention, early viral detection and identification of successful treatment protocols provide the best approach in controlling disease spread. In this review, current therapeutic options, preventive methods and transmission routes of COVID-19 are discussed."
"The Use of GIS Technology to Optimize COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution: A Case Study of the City of Warsaw, Poland.","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge, and the key to tackling it is vaccinating a specified percentage of the population to acquire herd immunity. The observed problems with the efficiency of the vaccination campaigns in numerous countries around the world, as well as the approach used at the initial stage of the National Immunization Program in Poland, prompted us to analyse the possibility of using GIS technology to optimize the distribution of vaccines to vaccination sites so as to minimize the period needed to vaccinate individual population groups. The research work was carried out on the example of Warsaw, the capital of Poland and the city with the largest population in the country. The analyses were carried out for the 60-70 and 50-60 age groups, in various approaches and for vaccines of different companies (Moderna, BioNTech, AstraZeneca), used to vaccinate people in Poland. The proposed approach to optimize vaccine distribution uses Thiessen's tessellation to obtain information on the number of people in a given population group living in the area of each vaccination site, and then to estimate the time needed to vaccinate that group. Compared to the originally used vaccination scenario with limited availability of vaccines, the proposed approach allows practitioners to design fast and efficient distribution scenarios. With the developed methodology, we demonstrated ways to achieve uniform vaccination coverage throughout the city. We anticipate that the proposed approach can be easily automated and broadly applied to various urban settings."
Essential considerations during vaccine design against COVID-19 and review of pioneering vaccine candidate platforms.,"The calamity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), COVID-19, is still a global human tragedy. To date, no specific antiviral drug or therapy has been able to break the widespread of SARS-CoV2. It has been generally believed that stimulating protective immunity via universal vaccination is the individual strategy to manage this pandemic. Achieving an effective COVID-19 vaccine requires attention to the immunological and non-immunological standpoints mentioned in this article. Here, we try to introduce the considerable immunological aspects, potential antigen targets, appropriate adjuvants as well as key points in the various stages of COVID-19 vaccine development. Also, the principal features of the preclinical and clinical studies of pioneering COVID-19 vaccine candidates were pointed out by reviewing the available information. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in the successful design of the COVID-19 vaccine and address the most fundamental strengths and weaknesses of common vaccine platforms."
Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future."
A novel DNA and protein combination COVID-19 vaccine formulation provides full protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques.,"The current study aims to develop a safe and highly immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine. The novel combination of a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant S1 protein vaccine induced high level neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses in both small and large animal models. More significantly, the co-delivery of DNA and protein components at the same time elicited full protection against intratracheal challenge of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in immunized rhesus macaques. As both DNA and protein vaccines have been proven safe in previous human studies, and DNA vaccines are capable of eliciting germinal center B cell development, which is critical for high-affinity memory B cell responses, the DNA and protein co-delivery vaccine approach has great potential to serve as a safe and effective approach to develop COVID-19 vaccines that provide long-term protection."
Caution in interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 quantification based on RT-PCR cycle threshold value.,"RT-PCR is the reference method for diagnosis of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. During the setting up of 6 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays in our laboratory, comparative evaluations were systematically undertaken and allowed to evidence major discrepancies on cycle threshold RT-PCR results between techniques. These tendencies were confirmed in routine application when analyzing sequential samples from the same patients. Our aim was to examine the impact of the technique among factors influencing RT-PCR result, a far surrogate of 'viral load' in the heterogeneous environment of respiratory specimens."
"Testing, tracing and isolation in compartmental models.","Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of contact tracing. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computational efficiency is such that it can be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks."
"Replication Kinetics, Cell Tropism, and Associated Immune Responses in SARS-CoV-2- and H5N1 Virus-Infected Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Models.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a wide variety of neurological complications. Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NPR1) expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type III interferons and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS. IMPORTANCE Infections with the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are often associated with neurological complications. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via the olfactory nerve; however, SARS-CoV-2 is only rarely detected in the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect neurons of human iPSC neural cultures but that this infection is abortive and does not result in virus spread to other cells. However, infection of neural cultures did result in the production of type III interferon and IL-8. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS and infect individual neurons, triggering local immune responses that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS disease."
"Characterization of a Lineage C.36 SARS-CoV-2 Isolate with Reduced Susceptibility to Neutralization Circulating in Lombardy, Italy.","SARS-CoV-2 spike is evolving to maximize transmissibility and evade the humoral response. The massive genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates has led to the identification of single-point mutations and deletions, often having the recurrence of hotspots, associated with advantageous phenotypes. We report the isolation and molecular characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain, belonging to a lineage (C.36) not previously associated with concerning traits, which shows decreased susceptibility to vaccine sera neutralization."
"Non-life-threatening adverse effects with COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine: A randomized, cross-sectional study on healthcare workers with detailed self-reported symptoms.","There are concerns regarding the side effects of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA-1273 vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United States. The objective of the study was to investigate the side effects of the mRNA-1273 vaccine with detailed review of organ systems. A randomized, cross-sectional study using an independent online survey questionnaire was conducted to collect responses from HCWs. Of all participants, 87.8% (1116/1271) provided complete responses. Of them, 38.7% (432/1116) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine, among which, 89.35% were females; 425 of these 432 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients (98.34%) reported at least one or more symptoms. The results were classified based on the frequency of symptoms reported postvaccination. Of these, 254/432 (58.8%) were able to continue their daily routine activities. 108/432 (25%) temporarily had trouble to perform daily activities, 120/432 (27.78%) required transient time off from work, 17/432 (3.94%) required help from an outpatient provider, 1/432 (0.23%) required help from emergency department, and none of them were hospitalized. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, 97.02% of the HCWs did not intend to skip the second dose of vaccine. Among all the symptoms reported, localized pain, generalized weakness, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, nausea, joint pains, sweating, localized swelling at the injection site, dizziness, itching, rash, decreased appetite, muscle spasm, decreased sleep quality, and brain fogging were the most commonly reported symptoms (in descending order of occurrence). Most of the symptoms reported were nonlife threatening. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, there appears to be a higher acceptance for this vaccine."
"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 N-Antibody Response in Healthcare Workers, London, UK.","Prospective serosurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 1,069 healthcare workers in London, UK, demonstrated that nucleocapsid antibody titers were stable and sustained for <12 weeks in 312 seropositive participants. This finding was consistent across demographic and clinical variables and contrasts with reports of short-term antibody waning."
"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Prevalence, Seroprevalence, and Exposure among Evacuees from Wuhan, China, 2020.","To determine prevalence of, seroprevalence of, and potential exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among a cohort of evacuees returning to the United States from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study of quarantined evacuees from 1 repatriation flight. Overall, 193 of 195 evacuees completed exposure surveys and submitted upper respiratory or serum specimens or both at arrival in the United States. Nearly all evacuees had taken preventive measures to limit potential exposure while in Wuhan, and none had detectable SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens, suggesting the absence of asymptomatic respiratory shedding among this group at the time of testing. Evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 1 evacuee, who reported experiencing no symptoms or high-risk exposures in the previous 2 months. These findings demonstrated that this group of evacuees posed a low risk of introducing SARS-CoV-2 to the United States."
"Impact of Mass Screening on the Number of Confirmed Cases, Recovered Cases, and Deaths Due to COVID-19 in Iran: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis.","Background: Mass screening for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Iran on March 23, 2020, with the purpose of improving early detection of patients for their own health and to prevent onward transmission to others. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the change towards mass screening on new cases reported, cases recovered, and deaths due to COVID-19. Methods: This study analyzed the daily reports on the number of new cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, cases recovered, and deaths due to COVID-19 provided to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran. Changes in trends on these outcomes were evaluated using interrupted time series analysis. Results: From February 19 to May 6, 2020, a total of 519544 COVID-19 tests were done and 101650 diagnoses were made (case/ test ratio 19.6%). For the same period, 6418 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported (case fatality ratio 6.3%). The number of cases detected increased significantly over the period of scale-up of mass screening (P=0.003), as did the number of recovered cases (P=0.001). The number of deaths due to COVID-19 did not change before versus after mass screening. Conclusion: Following the scale-up of mass screening for COVID-19 in Iran, the rate of new cases detected and reported recovered accelerated significantly. Mass screening is likely to have detected many mild and asymptomatic cases that were infectious. Our data support the role that mass screening, coupled with isolation and contract tracing, can have in slowing the COVID-19 epidemic."
Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV): Designing Master Protocols for Evaluation of Candidate COVID-19 Therapeutics.,"Working in an unprecedented time frame, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership developed and launched 9 master protocols between 14 April 2020 and 31 May 2021 to allow for the coordinated and efficient evaluation of multiple investigational therapeutic agents for COVID-19. The ACTIV master protocols were designed with a portfolio approach to serve the following patient populations with COVID-19: mild to moderately ill outpatients, moderately ill inpatients, and critically ill inpatients. To facilitate the execution of these studies and minimize start-up time, ACTIV selected several existing networks to launch the master protocols. The master protocols were also designed to test several agent classes prioritized by ACTIV that covered the spectrum of the disease pathophysiology. Each protocol, either adaptive or pragmatic, was designed to efficiently select those treatments that provide benefit to patients while rapidly eliminating those that were either ineffective or unsafe. The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group members describe the process by which these master protocols were designed, developed, and launched. Lessons learned that may be useful in meeting the challenges of a future pandemic are also described."
Low level SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in plasma samples from a cohort of Nigerians: Implications for blood transfusion.,"The present global pandemic triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has lingered for over a year in its devastating effects. Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently established with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by means of oropharyngeal-, nasopharyngeal-, anal-swabs, sputum and blood plasma. However, oral and nasal swabs are more commonly used. This study, therefore, assessed sensitivity and specificity of plasma as a diagnostic in comparison with a combination of oral and nasal swab samples, and the implications for blood transfusion. Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were obtained from 125 individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and stored in viral transport medium (VTM) tubes. Ten millilitres of blood samples in EDTA were also obtained by venepuncture and spun to obtain plasma. Viral RNA was obtained from both swabs and plasma by manual extraction with Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit. Detection was done using a real time fluorescent RT-qPCR BGI kit, on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR instrument. Average age of study participants was 41 years, with 74 (59.2%) being male. Out of the 125 individuals tested for COVID-19, 75 (60%) were positive by OP/NP swab. However, only 6 (4.8%) had a positive plasma result for COVID-19 with median Ct value of 32.4. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test using plasma was 8% and 100% respectively. There was no false positive recorded, but 69 (55.2%) false negatives were obtained by plasma. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected, albeit low (4.8%) in plasma. Plasma is likely not a suitable biological sample to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The implication of transfusing blood in this era of COVID-19 needs further investigations."
Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in children: a comprehensive review and pathophysiological considerations.,"Objective: The aim of this review was to summarize the most common extrapulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients with COVID-19, as well as to discuss clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological aspects of these clinical presentations in children. Source of data: An extensive search of literature was performed in order to identify pediatric cases with extrapulmonary manifestations between January 1, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Generic keywords, such as ""Novel coronavirus"" or ""Novel coronavirus 2019"" or ""2019 nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" were searched on PubMed database, associated either with age filters or generic pediatric terms. Summary of findings: A total of 28 articles, including 199 patients, were considered suitable to review and data extraction. The main findings were summarized in tables. The main non-pulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients, in decreasing order of frequency, were gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological and lymphatic, cutaneous, hepatic, ocular, olfactory, and gustatory. Multisystem impairment and Kawasaki-like disease were also described. Conclusions: Differences in immune response of children and variations of tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the virus receptor, are likely to influence clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological patterns of the disease."
Bayesian estimation of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Indiana by random testing.,"From 25 to 29 April 2020, the state of Indiana undertook testing of 3,658 randomly chosen state residents for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, the agent causing COVID-19 disease. This was the first statewide randomized study of COVID-19 testing in the United States. Both PCR and serological tests were administered to all study participants. This paper describes statistical methods used to address nonresponse among various demographic groups and to adjust for testing errors to reduce bias in the estimates of the overall disease prevalence in Indiana. These adjustments were implemented through Bayesian methods, which incorporated all available information on disease prevalence and test performance, along with external data obtained from census of the Indiana statewide population. Both adjustments appeared to have significant impact on the unadjusted estimates, mainly due to upweighting data in study participants of non-White races and Hispanic ethnicity and anticipated false-positive and false-negative test results among both the PCR and antibody tests utilized in the study."
Considerations on the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccine from trial design perspectives.,"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and an effective vaccine is needed. During the outbreak, the urgency for developing candidate vaccines has brought distinct challenges to clinical development. An efficacy trial, which measures whether the vaccine reduces the incidence of disease, is ordinarily required to fully evaluate vaccine efficacy. However, emergency use may be possible if promising immunogenicity results are observed. A ring vaccination trial, which recruits subjects connected to a known case either socially or geographically, is a solution to evaluate vaccine efficacy and control the spread of the disease simultaneously although its conduct is challenging. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 becomes a recurrent epidemic, an 'individual-level' efficacy trial is preferred. Innovative statistical designs, including seamless design, platform trial, master protocol design, are helpful to accelerate clinical development. A seamless Phase I/II design has been applied in multiple COVID-19 vaccine studies to date. However, Phase II/III design should be done very carefully. The control of type I error, maintaining trial blinding and statistical methods leading to unbiased estimates should be pre-specified in the clinical protocol. A Data Safety Monitoring Board is especially important, given the need to assure an adequate level of safety when society want a safe and effective vaccine."
Intestinal Microbiota in the SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What Is Known?,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, emerged last year in China and quickly spread to millions of people around the world. This virus infects cells in different tissues and causes pulmonary (e.g., pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome), neurological, cardiovascular, and intestinal manifestations, which can be the result of a direct viral effect or secondary to endothelial, thrombotic, or immunological alterations. In this chapter, we discuss recent studies which highlighted the relevance of the intestinal microbiota for other infectious respiratory diseases. We present the ""altered microbiota"" (dysbiotic) as a point of connection between conditions that are risk factors for the development of severe forms of COVID-19. In addition, we describe the findings of recent studies reporting alterations of microbiota composition in COVID-19 patients and speculate on how this may impact in development of the disease."
Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia despite missing detection of viral nucleic acid and initially inconspicuous radiologic findings.,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia."
Expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in inclusion bodies and its application in serological detection.,"The current standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, virus antibody detection has the advantages of convenient sample collection, high throughout, and low cost. When combining detection with nucleic acid detection, antibody detection can effectively compensate for nucleic acid detection. Virus infection always induce high antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein), which can be used to detect COVID-19 at both infected and convalescent patients. In this study we reported the expression and purification of N protein in E.coli from inclusion bodies by a combination of two cation exchange chromatography, and the yield of N protein was around 50 mg/L fermentation broth with more than 90% purity. A corresponding colloidal gold detection kit prepared with our purified N protein was used to verify the efficiency and accuracy our N protein in antibody detection method. Of the 58 COVID-19 PCR positive patients' inactivated serum samples, 40 samples were IgM positive (69.0%), and 42 samples were IgG positive (72.4%), and all 95 COVID-19 negative patients' inactivated serum samples were both IgM and IgG negative. Our results indicates that the refolded soluble N protein could be used for the preliminary detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV- 2."
SARS-CoV-2 impact on oral health: A general view.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019, and a few months later, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. Oral ulcers in adult patients have been associated with COVID-19. However, no cases have yet been documented in children. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified in tissues of the oral cavity. Studies have identified the tongue as the site with the highest expression of ACE2, and the oral epithelium, gingival epithelium, and salivary glands as sites of lesser extent expression. ACE2 expression is lower in children and varies with age. SARS-CoV-2 in saliva has been identified in various studies, which suggests that this could be a useful sample for diagnosis. However, its presence in saliva would indicate the high risk of contagion of this fluid."
Recent progress on rapid SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 detection by CRISPR-Cas13-based platforms.,"The limitations of conventional diagnostic procedures, such as real-time PCR-based methods and serological tests, have led the scientific community to innovate alternative nucleic acid detection approaches for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby addressing the dire need for increased testing. Such approaches aim to provide rapid, accurate, cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, on multiple specimen types, and without specialized equipment and expertise. The CRISPR-Cas13 system functions as a sequence-specific RNA-sensing tool that has recently been harnessed to develop simplified and flexible testing formats. This review recapitulates technical advances in the most recent CRISPR-Cas13-based methods for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The challenges and opportunities for implementing mass testing using these novel CRISPR-Cas13 platforms are critically analyzed."
Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 210 countries around the world. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. However, the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30% to 60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. A reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) method was established and evaluated. To explore the feasibility of RT-dPCR in diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2, a total of 196 clinical pharyngeal swab samples from 103 suspected patients, 77 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents were analyzed by RT-qPCR and then measured by the proposed RT-dPCR. For the 103 fever suspected patients, 19 (19/25) negative and 42 (42/49) equivocal tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For 29 close contacts (confirmed by additional sample and clinical follow up), 16 (16/17) equivocal and 1 negative tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR, which is implying that the RT-qPCR is missing a lot of asymptomatic patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 91%, 100% and 93%, respectively. RT-dPCR is highly accurate method and suitable for detection of pharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 suspected patients and patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms."
First Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 on the Surfaces of Tourist-Recreational Facilities in Italy.,"A Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads via direct contact through droplets produced by infected individuals. The transmission of this virus can also occur via indirect contact if objects and surfaces are contaminated by secretions from individuals with COVID-19 or asymptomatic carriers. Environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 is high in hospital settings; on the contrary, surface contamination in non-healthcare settings is still poorly studied. In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the surfaces of 20 tourist-recreational facilities was investigated by performing a total of 100 swabs on surfaces, including refrigerator handles, handrails, counters, tables, and bathroom access doors. Six (6%) swabs from four (20%) tourist-recreational facilities tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; the surfaces that were involved were toilet door handles, refrigerator handles, handrails, and bar counters. This study highlights that SARS-CoV-2 is also present in non-healthcare environments; therefore, in order to limit this worrying pandemic, compliance with behavioral rules and the adoption of preventive and protective measures are of fundamental importance not only in healthcare or work environments but also in life environments."
"Multicentre comparison of quantitative PCR-based assays to detect SARS-CoV-2, Germany, March 2020.","Containment strategies and clinical management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients during the current pandemic depend on reliable diagnostic PCR assays for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we compare 11 different RT-PCR test systems used in seven diagnostic laboratories in Germany in March 2020. While most assays performed well, we identified detection problems in a commonly used assay that may have resulted in false-negative test results during the first weeks of the pandemic."
Neutralization of Beta and Delta variant with sera of COVID-19 recovered cases and vaccinees of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine BBV152/Covaxin.,"SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern mainly Delta and Beta is global public health concern due to its impact on existing vaccines. Here, we assessed the neutralization of sera from COVID-19 recovered cases and BBV152 vaccinees against Beta and Delta variants. BBV152 vaccine found to confer significant protection against both the variants."
Molecular mechanisms of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-COVID19 pharmacological targets since the outbreak of the pandemic.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets. This review focuses on the most researched SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their structure, function, and possible therapeutic approaches."
"Outbreak Investigation of COVID-19 Among Residents and Staff of an Independent and Assisted Living Community for Older Adults in Seattle, Washington.","Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused epidemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area, with morbidity and mortality concentrated among residents of skilled nursing facilities. The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, setting, and participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main outcomes and measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread."
Role of Structural and Non-Structural Proteins and Therapeutic Targets of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, comprising single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (+ ssRNA) of around 26 to 32 kilobases, and has been known to cause infection to a myriad of mammalian hosts, such as humans, cats, bats, civets, dogs, and camels with varied consequences in terms of death and debilitation. Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88% of sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, respectively. Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV displays 10-20 times greater affinity for its cognate host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5' end of + ssRNA genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated replication-transcription molecular events lead to the synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural and accessory proteins participating in structure formation and various molecular functions of virus, respectively. These multiple structural proteins assemble and encapsulate genomic RNA (gRNA), resulting in numerous viral progenies, which eventually exit the host cell, and spread infection to rest of the body. In this review, we primarily focus on genomic organization, structural and non-structural protein components, and potential prospective molecular targets for development of therapeutic drugs, convalescent plasm therapy, and a myriad of potential vaccines to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Delirium in COVID-19: epidemiology and clinical correlations in a large group of patients admitted to an academic hospital.,"Background: Delirium incidence and clinical correlates in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia are still poorly investigated. Aim: To describe the epidemiology of delirium in patients hospitalized for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia during the pandemic peak in an academic hospital of Northern Italy, identify its clinical correlations and evaluate the association with mortality. Methods: The clinical records of 852 patients admitted for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as respiratory symptoms or fever or certain history of contact with COVID-19 patients, plus chest CT imaging compatible with alveolar-interstitial pneumonia, were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was defined after careful revision of daily clinical reports in accordance with the Confusion Assessment Method criteria. Data on age, clinical presentation, comorbidities, drugs, baseline lab tests and outcome were collected. The factors associated with delirium, and the association of delirium with mortality, were evaluated through binary logistic regression models. Results: Ninety-four patients (11%) developed delirium during stay. They were older (median age 82, interquartile range, IQR 78-89, vs 75, IQR 63-84, p < 0.001), had more neuropsychiatric comorbidities and worse respiratory exchanges at baseline. At multivariate models, delirium was independently and positively associated with age [odds ratio (OR) 1.093, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046-1.143, p < 0.001], use of antipsychotic drugs (OR 4.529, 95% CI 1.204-17.027, p = 0.025), serum urea and lactate-dehydrogenase at admission. Despite a higher mortality in patients with delirium (57% vs 30%), this association was not independent of age and respiratory parameters. Conclusions: Delirium represents a common complication of COVID-19 and a marker of severe disease course, especially in older patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidity."
The value of decreasing the duration of the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.,"Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population. We developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential clinical and economic impact of reducing the infectious period duration. Simulation experiments found that reducing the average infectious period duration could avert a median of 442,852 [treating 25% of symptomatic cases, reducing by 0.5 days, reproductive number (R0) 3.5, and starting treatment when 15% of the population has been exposed] to 44.4 million SARS-CoV-2 cases (treating 75% of all infected cases, reducing by 3.5 days, R0 2.0). With R0 2.5, reducing the average infectious period duration by 0.5 days for 25% of symptomatic cases averted 1.4 million cases and 99,398 hospitalizations; increasing to 75% of symptomatic cases averted 2.8 million cases. At $500/person, treating 25% of symptomatic cases saved $209.5 billion (societal perspective). Further reducing the average infectious period duration by 3.5 days averted 7.4 million cases (treating 25% of symptomatic cases). Expanding treatment to 75% of all infected cases, including asymptomatic infections (R0 2.5), averted 35.9 million cases and 4 million hospitalizations, saving $48.8 billion (societal perspective and starting treatment after 5% of the population has been exposed). Our study quantifies the potential effects of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infectious period duration."
Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Allows for Up to 10-Fold Efficiency Increase Across Realistic Scenarios and Testing Strategies.,"Background: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demand for diagnostic testing has increased drastically, resulting in shortages of necessary materials to conduct the tests and overwhelming the capacity of testing laboratories. The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals, which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing. Methods: We account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime, we provide analysis for several realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures. Key Findings: We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high- vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1.47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if the infection rate is below 0.4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6.69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%. Moreover, we provide an interactive web application, available at www.grouptexting.com, for visualizing the different strategies and designing pooling schemes according to specific prevalence scenarios and test configurations. Interpretation: Altogether, this work may help provide a basis for an efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, which takes the population heterogeneity into account and is fine-grained towards the desired study populations, e.g., mild/asymptomatic individuals vs. symptomatic ones but also mixtures thereof.

COVID-19 antibody screening with SARS-CoV-2 red cell kodecytes using routine serologic diagnostic platforms.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major global impact, and the resultant response in the development of new diagnostics is unprecedented. The detection of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a role in managing the pandemic. We evaluated the feasibility of using SARS-CoV-2 peptide Kode Technology-modified red cells (C19-kodecytes) to develop an assay compatible with existing routine serologic platforms. Study design and methods: A panel of eight unique red cells modified using Kode Technology function-spacer-lipid constructs and bearing short SARS-CoV-2 peptides was developed (C19-kodecyte assay). Kodecytes were tested against undiluted expected antibody-negative and -positive plasma samples in manual tube and three column agglutination technology (CAT) platforms. Parallel analysis with the same peptides in solid phase by enzyme immunoassays was performed. Evaluation samples included >120 expected negative blood donor samples and >140 COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with independent serologic analysis from two centers. Results: Specificity (negative reaction rate against expected negative samples) in three different CAT platforms against novel C19-kodecytes was >91%, which correlated with published literature. Sensitivity (positive reaction rate against expected positive convalescent, PCR-confirmed samples) ranged from 82% to 97% compared to 77% with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Manual tube serology was less sensitive than CAT. Enzyme immunoassay results with some Kode Technology constructs also had high sensitivity. Conclusions: C19-kodecytes are viable for use as serologic reagent red cells for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody with routine blood antibody screening equipment."
Risk prediction of covid-19 related death and hospital admission in adults after covid-19 vaccination: national prospective cohort study.,"Objectives: To derive and validate risk prediction algorithms to estimate the risk of covid-19 related mortality and hospital admission in UK adults after one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination. Design: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions, systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries. Settings: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices. Results: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Down's syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson's disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. Conclusion: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination."
"Pandemic COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2: genetic structure, vaccination, and therapeutic approaches.","We give a summary of SARS-genetic CoV-2's structure and evolution, as well as current attempts to develop efficient vaccine and treatment methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this article. Most therapeutic strategies are based on repurposing of existing therapeutic agents used against various virus infections and focused mainly on inhibition of the virus replication cycle, enhancement of innate immunity, and alleviation of CRS caused by COVID-19. Currently, more than 100 clinical trials on COVID-19 aim to provide robust evidence on the efficacy of the currently available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral substances, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and drugs directed against docking of SARS-CoV-2 to the membrane-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The current vaccination campaign is ongoing worldwide using different types of vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Novavax, and others with efficacy ranging from 72-95%. In March 2021 Germany limited the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to people 60 years of age and older due to concerns that it may be causing blood clots. Further study and more data are needed to confirm the safety of different available vaccines."
Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols.,"A key consideration in the Covid-19 pandemic is the dominant modes of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for the potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and National Health Service UK evidence up to 27 July 2020. A protocol was published and Cochrane guidance for rapid review methodology was adhered to throughout. Twenty-eight studies were identified. Seven out of eight epidemiological studies suggest aerosol transmission may occur, with enclosed environments and poor ventilation noted as possible contextual factors. Ten of the 16 air sampling studies detected SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid; however, only three of these studies attempted to culture the virus with one being successful in a limited number of samples. Two of four virological studies using artificially generated aerosols indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is viable in aerosols. The results of this review indicate there is inconclusive evidence regarding the viability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Epidemiological studies suggest possible transmission, with contextual factors noted. Viral particles have been detected in air sampling studies with some evidence of clinical infectivity, and virological studies indicate these particles may represent live virus, adding further plausibility. However, there is uncertainty as to the nature and impact of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and its relative contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic compared with other modes of transmission."
The Immunologists' Guide to Pandemic Preparedness.,"Immunologists are central to fighting any pandemic. From pathogenesis to disease modeling, pharmaceuticals to vaccines, immunologists play a crucial role in translating basic science into effective response strategies. This article describes our view on how lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be developed into an immunologists' guide for preparedness for future pandemics."
COVID-19 Vaccine: Practical Clinical Considerations.,This article summarizes the ACP/Annals COVID-19 Vaccine Forum IV held on 24 March 2021.
Rapid and Repetitive Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and Human Coronavirus on Self-Disinfecting Anionic Polymers.,"While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affirms an urgent global need for effective vaccines as second and third infection waves are spreading worldwide and generating new mutant virus strains, it has also revealed the importance of mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the introduction of restrictive social practices. Here, it is demonstrated that an architecturally- and chemically-diverse family of nanostructured anionic polymers yield a rapid and continuous disinfecting alternative to inactivate coronaviruses and prevent their transmission from contact with contaminated surfaces. Operating on a dramatic pH-drop mechanism along the polymer/pathogen interface, polymers of this archetype inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as a human coronavirus surrogate (HCoV-229E), to the minimum detection limit within minutes. Application of these anionic polymers to frequently touched surfaces in medical, educational, and public-transportation facilities, or personal protection equipment, can provide rapid and repetitive protection without detrimental health or environmental complications."
Variation and multilevel selection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. Theory predicts a group-structured population with selection acting principally at two levels: the pathogen individuals and the group of pathogens within a single host individual. Rapid replication of individual viruses is selected for, but if this replication debilitates the host before transmission occurs, the entire group of viruses in that host may perish. Thus, rapid transmission can favor more pathogenic strains, while slower transmission can favor less pathogenic strains. Available data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may follow this pattern. Indeed, high population density and other circumstances that favor rapid transmission may also favor more deadly strains. Health care workers, exposed to pathogenic strains of hospitalized patients, may be at greater risk. The low case fatality rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may reflect the founder effect-an initial infection with a mild strain. A vaccine made with one strain may confer limited immunity to other strains. Variation among strains may lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to therapeutics. Finally, if less pathogenic strains are largely associated with mild disease, rather than treating all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals equally, priority could be focused on testing and contact tracing the most seriously symptomatic patients."
Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population: Analysis of nationwide serosurvey data in the Netherlands.,"Background: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who are asymptomatic-and whether this proportion is age-dependent-are still open research questions. Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or 'crude' proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Based on two rounds of a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May and June/July 2020 in the Netherlands (n = 7517), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR. Results: Using age-aggregated data, the 'crude' AP was 37% but the model-estimated AP was 65% (95% CI 63-68%). The estimated AP varied with age, from 74% (95% CI 65-90%) for < 20 years, to 61% (95% CI 57-65%) for the 50-59 years age-group. Conclusion: Whereas the 'crude' AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies."
Analysis of sputum/tracheal aspirate and nasopharyngeal samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection by laboratory-developed test and Panther Fusion system.,"In this study, 127 sputum/tracheal aspirate specimens were evaluated by a laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR method and Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay. These specimens were collected from the patients who have nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples being used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously or simultaneously. The overall agreement was 96% between the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and NPS samples, suggesting that LRT specimens could be an option for patients who develop a productive cough or those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation."
Therapeutics and Vaccines: Strengthening Our Fight Against the Global Pandemic COVID-19.,"The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health concern globally posing a significant threat to human health and economy and creating an unprecedented crisis in all spheres of the global life. Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment. There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies. Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets. This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV. A detailed knowledge may pave the way to combat this pandemic COVID-19 as well as prevent similar deadly epidemics in future."
Anterior Scleritis Manifesting After Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Report of Two Cases.,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report 2 patients with anterior scleritis manifesting after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: The patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed anterior scleritis after their systemic symptoms were markedly improved. A thorough systemic workup identified no underlying autoimmune diseases. Ocular characteristics and safety and efficacy of systemic immunosuppressive therapy were evaluated. Results: Case 1 was a 67-year-old woman who presented with necrotizing anterior scleritis in both eyes 3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19. One-week treatment with topical betamethasone and oral prednisolone (65 mg daily) did not result in improvement, so she was started on intravenous cyclophosphamide and subcutaneous adalimumab in addition to oral prednisolone. Necrotizing scleritis was gradually improved over 3 months. Case 2 was a 33-year-old man who presented with sectoral anterior scleritis in his right eye 2 weeks after the onset of COVID-19. He was started on topical betamethasone and oral prednisolone (85 mg daily). One week later, all signs and symptoms disappeared, and topical and oral corticosteroids were gradually tapered off over 2 weeks. There was no recurrence of respiratory symptoms or active scleritis in any cases after discontinuation of treatment. Conclusions: These cases suggest that COVID-19 can be associated with anterior scleritis, which responds to immunosuppressive and biologic agents. Ophthalmologists should consider anterior scleritis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ocular pain and redness during the convalescent phase of the illness."
Evaluation of the MP Rapid 2019-NCOV IgM/IgG combo POCT test vs. an established platform-based method.,"Background: Accurate and rapid testing for SARS-COV-2 antibodies could improve the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available point-of-care lateral flow kit independently and in comparison to an established platform-based system. Method: Samples from 144 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 130 pre-pandemic negative controls were tested in parallel by MP Rapid 2019-NCOV IgM/IgG Combo test and Roche Elecsys. Comparison of results based on serum and capillary blood testing was undertaken. Results: Sensitivity at day 15 onwards was 100% for both methods. Between days 1 and 7 post admission, the IgM/IgG Combo test and Roche Elecsys shown sensitivity of 74% (95%CI: 62%-85%) vs. 67% (95% CI: 55%-79%, P = 0.3947). Combo test specificities were 100% for IgG, 98.5% for IgM vs. Roche Elecsys specificity of 100%. Concordance analysis showed 98.5% agreement to the Roche Elecsys method (Cohen's Kappa 0.96 95% CI [0.92-0.99]). Capillary blood results showed complete agreement with serum samples using the Combo test. Conclusion: In comparison to Roche Elecsys, our data show that the MP Rapid 2019-NCOV IgM/IgG Combo test provides a high-confidence assay system for the detection of previous exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection with advantage of affording near-patient testing."
Design and Multicenter Clinical Validation of a 3-Dimensionally Printed Nasopharyngeal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"Importance: Three-dimensionally printed nasopharyngeal swabs (3DP swabs) have been used to mitigate swab shortages during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical validation for diagnostic accuracy and consistency, as well as patient acceptability, is crucial to evaluate the swab's performance. Objective: To determine the accuracy and acceptability of the 3DP swab for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design, setting, and participants: A diagnostic study was conducted from May to July 2020 at 2 tertiary care centers in Singapore with different reference swabs (FLOQSwab [COPAN Diagnostics] or Dacron swab [Deltalab]) and swab processing techniques (wet or dry) to evaluate the performance of the 3DP swab compared with traditional, standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swabs used in health care institutions. The participants were patients with COVID-19 in the first 2 weeks of illness and controls with acute respiratory illness with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of swabs was randomized based on odd and even participant numbers. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcome measures were overall agreement (OA), positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement of the 3DP swab compared with reference swabs. Secondary outcome measures were the correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values of both swabs. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 45.4 (13.1) years, and most participants were men (87 of 89 [97.8%]), in keeping with the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. A total of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls were recruited. Among the patients with COVID-19, the overall agreement and PPA of the 3DP swab was 91.1% and 93.5%, respectively, compared with reference swabs. The PPA was 100% for patients with COVID-19 who were tested within the first week of illness. All controls tested negative. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction Ct values for the ORF1ab and E-gene targets showed a strong correlation (intraclass correlations coefficient, 0.869-0.920) between the 3DP and reference swab on independent testing at each institution despite differences in sample processing. Discordant results for both gene targets were observed only at high Ct values. Conclusions and relevance: In this diagnostic study of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls, the 3DP swab performed accurately and consistently across health care institutions and could help mitigate strained resources in the escalating COVID-19 pandemic."
Mask use during COVID-19: A risk adjusted strategy.,"In the context of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) cases globally, there is a lack of consensus across cultures on whether wearing face masks is an effective physical intervention against disease transmission. This study 1) illustrates transmission routes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); 2) addresses controversies surrounding the mask from perspectives of attitude, effectiveness, and necessity of wearing the mask with evidence that the use of mask would effectively interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in both hospital settings and community settings; and 3) provides suggestion that the public should wear the mask during COVID-19 pandemic according to local context. To achieve this goal, government should establish a risk adjusted strategy of mask use to scientifically publicize the use of masks, guarantee sufficient supply of masks, and cooperate for reducing health resources inequities."
Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study.,"Objective: To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Design: Matched cohort study. Setting: Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection). Participants: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. Main outcome measure: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Results: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases. Conclusions: The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2."
Disposable face masks and reusable face coverings as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants that cause coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Role of new sustainable NPI design innovations and predictive mathematical modelling.,"Best-published evidence supports the combined use of vaccines with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), to reduce the relative risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19; this will enable a safe transition to achieving herd immunity. Albeit complex, the strategic public health goal is to bundle NPIs to keep the basic reproduction number R0 below one. However, validation of these NPIs is conducted using random clinical trials, which is challenging in a swiftly moving pandemic given the need for recruiting large participant cohort over a longitudinal analysis period. This review highlights emerging innovations for potentially improving the design, functionality and improved waste management of disposable face masks such as filtering facepiece (FFPs) respirators, medical masks, and reusable face coverings to help prevent COVID-19. It describes use of different mathematical models under varying scenarios to inform efficacy of single and combined use of NPIs as important counter-measures to break the cycle of COVID-19 infection including new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Demand for face masks during COVID-19 pandemic keeps increasing, especially for FFPs worn by medical workers. Collaborative and well-conducted randomised controlled trials across borders are required to generate robust data to inform common and consistent policies for COVID-19 and future pandemic planning and management; however, current use of systematic reviews of best available evidence can be considered to guide interim policies."
[Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective].,"Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings.The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement.The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations."
"Molecular Perspectives of SARS-CoV-2: Pathology, Immune Evasion, and Therapeutic Interventions.","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not only affected human health but also diverted the focus of research and derailed the world economy over the past year. Recently, vaccination against COVID-19 has begun, but further studies on effective therapeutic agents are still needed. The severity of COVID-19 is attributable to several factors such as the dysfunctional host immune response manifested by uncontrolled viral replication, type I interferon suppression, and release of impaired cytokines by the infected resident and recruited cells. Due to the evolving pathophysiology and direct involvement of the host immune system in COVID-19, the use of immune-modulating drugs is still challenging. For the use of immune-modulating drugs in severe COVID-19, it is important to balance the fight between the aggravated immune system and suppression of immune defense against the virus that causes secondary infection. In addition, the interplaying events that occur during virus-host interactions, such as activation of the host immune system, immune evasion mechanism of the virus, and manifestation of different stages of COVID-19, are disjunctive and require thorough streamlining. This review provides an update on the immunotherapeutic interventions implemented to combat COVID-19 along with the understanding of molecular aspects of the immune evasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may provide opportunities to develop more effective and promising therapeutics."
Potential neuroinvasive pathways of SARS-CoV-2: Deciphering the spectrum of neurological deficit seen in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert health care professionals early in the course of COVID-19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID-19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID-19, the host-virus interaction, possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system, other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID-19, and a collective call to action."
Influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review from the climate change perspective.,"Ever since the global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) in the early part of 2020, there is no doubt that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has placed great tension globally and has affected almost all aspects of human endeavors. There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed."
Seroepidemiologic Study Designs for Determining SARS-COV-2 Transmission and Immunity.,"Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying dynamics of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Past work on serologic studies (e.g., during influenza pandemics) has made relevant contributions, but specific conditions of the current situation require adaptation. Although detection of antibodies to measure exposure, immunity, or both seems straightforward conceptually, numerous challenges exist in terms of sample collection, what the presence of antibodies actually means, and appropriate analysis and interpretation to account for test accuracy and sampling biases. Successful deployment of serologic studies depends on type and performance of serologic tests, population studied, use of adequate study designs, and appropriate analysis and interpretation of data. We highlight key questions that serologic studies can help answer at different times, review strengths and limitations of different assay types and study designs, and discuss methods for rapid sharing and analysis of serologic data to determine global transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."
PPE training and the effectiveness of universal masking in preventing exposures: The importance of the relationship between anesthesia and infection prevention.,"Early in the pandemic, infection prevention (IP), in collaboration with our local anesthesia leadership, took the approach of ensuring all members of the Anesthesia Department understood the importance of universal masking, were individually trained on the use of the Controlled Air Purifier Respirator, as well the appropriate method for donning/doffing N95 respirators. Multiple providers in the department tested positive for COVID, resulting in the IP Department to conduct the routine contact tracing investigation. During the investigation, it was determined that all persons who met the CDC (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) contact exposure guidelines would undergo COVID testing, which consequently was 109 team members due to the exposure risk identified in the break room space. IP worked with the Anesthesia Preoperative Clinic to test all team members identified over a 3-day period (approximately 5-7 days postexposure). Out of the 109 team members who were tested postexposure, there were 0 conversions. The department attributes this to the consistency in personal protective equipment training, support and collaboration between anesthesia and IP which led to successful care for COVID patients with a limited provider infection rate."
Indoor Model Simulation for COVID-19 Transport and Exposure.,"Transmission of respiratory viruses is a complex process involving emission, deposition in the airways, and infection. Inhalation is often the most relevant transmission mode in indoor environments. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the risk of inhalation transmission is not yet fully understood. Here, we used an indoor aerosol model combined with a regional inhaled deposited dose model to examine the indoor transport of aerosols from an infected person with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to a susceptible person and assess the potential inhaled dose rate of particles. Two scenarios with different ventilation rates were compared, as well as adult female versus male recipients. Assuming a source strength of 10 viruses/s, in a tightly closed room with poor ventilation (0.5 h-1), the respiratory tract deposited dose rate was 140-350 and 100-260 inhaled viruses/hour for males and females; respectively. With ventilation at 3 h-1 the dose rate was only 30-90 viruses/hour. Correcting for the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in air, these numbers are reduced by a factor of 1.2-2.2 for poorly ventilated rooms and 1.1-1.4 for well-ventilated rooms. Combined with future determinations of virus emission rates, the size distribution of aerosols containing the virus, and the infectious dose, these results could play an important role in understanding the full picture of potential inhalation transmission in indoor environments."
SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses in Infection-Naive or Previously Infected Individuals After 1 and 2 Doses of the BNT162b2 Vaccine.,This cohort study examines antibody responses in infection-naive and previously infected individuals after 1 and 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine.
Guidelines on newly identified limitations of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and consequences.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised."
Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays as a rapid diagnostic for COVID-19.,"Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has emerged, rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community. Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 h to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times."
"Association of Lower Socioeconomic Status and SARS-CoV-2 Positivity in Los Angeles, California.","Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads heterogeneously, disproportionately impacting poor and minority communities. The relationship between poverty and race is complex, with a diverse set of structural and systemic factors driving higher rates of poverty among minority populations. The factors that specifically contribute to the disproportionate rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, are not clearly understood. Methods: We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 test results from community-based testing sites in Los Angeles, California, between June and December, 2020. We used tester zip code data to link those results with United States Census report data on average annual household income, rates of healthcare coverage, and employment status by zip code. Results: We analyzed 2 141 127 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 245 154 (11.4%) were positive. Multivariable modeling showed a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among Hispanic communities than among other races. We found an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 positivity among individuals from zip codes with an average annual household income <US$65 000 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72 to 1.82), as well as from zip codes with <85% of individuals with health insurance (aOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33), and <60% of individuals employed (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.44). Conclusions: Residence in zip codes with lower average annual household income, lower rates of employment, or lower rates of health insurance was associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further research is needed into how those factors increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among populations of lower socioeconomic status in order to develop targeted public health interventions."
Pangolins Harbor SARS-CoV-2-Related Coronaviruses.,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a severe threat to global public health. Yet, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains mysterious. Several recent studies (e.g., Lam et al.,Xiao et al.) identified SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in pangolins, providing novel insights into the evolution and diversity of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses."
Rapid Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Vaccine Candidates.,"The coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus resulted in economic losses and threatened human health worldwide. The pandemic highlights an urgent need for a stable, easily produced, and effective vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind its cognate receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and initiate membrane fusion. Thus, the RBD is an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates, namely, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer), and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), via covalent conjugation using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. When mice were immunized with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) in conjunction with the AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System, the resulting antisera exhibited 8- to 120-fold greater neutralizing activity against both a pseudovirus and the authentic virus than those of mice immunized with monomeric RBD. Most importantly, sera from mice immunized with RBD-conjugated NPs more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 in vitro, further corroborating the promising immunization effect. Additionally, the vaccine has distinct advantages in terms of a relatively simple scale-up and flexible assembly. These results illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study are a competitive vaccine candidate and that the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as a universal platform for a future vaccine development."
Incidence of Axillary Adenopathy in Breast Imaging After COVID-19 Vaccination.,"This case series examines the incidence, timing, and characteristics of mammographic axillary adenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination."
Parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years among Chinese doctors and nurses: a cross-sectional online survey.,"This study investigated parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years among Chinese parents who are healthcare workers. A closed online survey among full-time doctors or nurses employed by the five collaborative hospitals who had access to smartphones was conducted. Facilitated by the hospital administrators, prospective participants received an invitation sent by the research team via the existing WeChat/QQ groups to complete an online questionnaire. A total of 2,281 participants completed the survey. This study was a sub-analysis of 1332 participants who had at least one child under the age of 18 years. Among the participants, 44.5% reported that they would likely or very likely to have their children under the age of 18 years take up COVID-19 vaccination in the next six months. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, perceived higher vaccine efficacy, longer protection duration, perceived high/very high chance for China to prevent another wave of COVID-19 outbreak with vaccines in place and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. At interpersonal level, higher frequency of information exposure through social media and direct interpersonal communication were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination, while knowing some people who experienced serious side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Despite their important roles in vaccination promotion, Chinese doctors and nurses showed low parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Effective health promotion is needed when COVID-19 vaccination become available."
Convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019: A preliminary report.,"Background: The role of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Methods: We retrospectively compared outcomes in a cohort of critical COVID-19 patients who received standard care (SC Group) and those who, in addition, received convalescent plasma (CP Group). Results: In total, 40 patients were included in each group. The median patient age was 53.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 42-60.5), and the majority of patients required invasive ventilation (69, 86.2%). Plasma was harvested from donors after a median of 37 days (IQR 31-46) from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result and 26 days (IQR 21-32) after documented viral clearance; it was administered after a median of 10 days (IQR 9-10) from the onset of symptoms and 2.5 days (IQR 2-4) from admission to intensive care unit. The primary endpoint of improvement in respiratory support status within 28 days was achieved in 26 patients (65%) in the SC Group and 31 patients (77.5%) in the CP Group (p = .32). The 28-day all-cause mortality (12.5% vs. 2.5%; p = .22) and viral clearance (65% vs. 55%; p = .49) were not significantly different between the two groups. Convalescent plasma was not significantly associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.51-1.49; p = .62). Adverse events were balanced between the two study groups. Conclusion: In severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy was not associated with clinical benefits. Randomized trials are required to confirm our findings."
"SARS-CoV-2 Superspread in Fitness Center, Hong Kong, China, March 2021.","To investigate a superspreading event at a fitness center in Hong Kong, China, we used genomic sequencing to analyze 102 reverse transcription PCR-confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Our finding highlights the risk for virus transmission in confined spaces with poor ventilation and limited public health interventions."
Chest Radiography in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Correlation with Clinical Course.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. A definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is made after a positive result is obtained on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. In Singapore, rigorous contact tracing was practised to contain the spread of the virus. Nasal swabs and chest radiographs (CXR) were also taken from individuals who were suspected to be infected by COVID-19 upon their arrival at a centralised screening centre. From our experience, about 40% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had initial CXR that appeared ""normal"". In this case series, we described the temporal evolution of COVID-19 in patients with an initial ""normal"" CXR. Since CXR has limited sensitivity and specificity in COVID-19, it is not suitable as a first-line diagnostic tool. However, when CXR changes become unequivocally abnormal, close monitoring is recommended to manage potentially severe COVID-19 pneumonia."
"SARS-CoV-2 variants, spike mutations and immune escape.","Although most mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome are expected to be either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively neutral, a small proportion will affect functional properties and may alter infectivity, disease severity or interactions with host immunity. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of 'variants of concern', that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets."
An enveloped virus-like particle vaccine expressing a stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits highly potent immunity.,"We evaluated enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) expressing various forms of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and several adjuvants in an effort to identify a highly potent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate. eVLPs expressing a modified prefusion form of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were selected as they induced high antibody binding titers and neutralizing activity after a single injection in mice. Formulation of SARS-CoV-2 S eVLPs with aluminum phosphate resulted in balanced induction of IgG2 and IgG1 isotypes and antibody binding and neutralization titers were undiminished for more than 3 months after a single immunization. A single dose of this candidate, named VBI-2902a, protected Syrian golden hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2 and supports the on-going clinical evaluation of VBI-2902a as a highly potent vaccine against COVID-19."
Versatile and flexible microfluidic qPCR test for high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 and cellular response detection in nasopharyngeal swab samples.,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the BiomarkTM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of BiomarkTM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities."
From SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2: safety and broad-spectrum are important for coronavirus vaccine development.,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV and HCoV-19) has posed serious threats to public health and economic stability worldwide, thus calling for development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have high similarity of their genomic sequences and share the same cellular receptor (ACE2), it is essential to learn the lessons and experiences from the development of SARS-CoV vaccines for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of the SARS-CoV vaccine candidates and prospected the strategies for the development of safe, effective and broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccines for prevention of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause future epidemics or pandemics."
The potential use of ABO blood group system for risk stratification of COVID-19.,"ABO blood groups is a cheap and affordable test that can be immediately retrieved from COVID-19 patients at the diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that non-O blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of patients at higher risk for complications. On a therapeutic level, plasma from normal O blood group individuals might potentially replace the use of convalescent serum for the treatment of COVID-19."
Panuveitis following Vaccination for COVID-19.,"Background: COVID-19 vaccination has been accompanied by reports of inflammatory events. This report details a case of panuveitis following vaccination for COVID-19 Case.Description: A 43 year old female developed panuveitis with decreased vision three days after her second dose of Pfizer-Biontech mRNA vaccine. The choroid was significantly thickened and there was anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation. Shortly after onset of ocular symptoms she was also found have an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Treatment with oral and topical corticosteroids resulted in improvement in the panuveitis, with a mild recurrence after the initial attempt to taper these drugs.Conclusion: This report demonstrates a likely occurrence of vaccine-related panuveitis secondary to the Pfizer-Biotech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19."
SARS-CoV-2 viral load assessment in respiratory samples.,"Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) has been the main method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. De-identified results from upper and lower respiratory samples submitted to a reference laboratory demonstrated a positivity rate of 14.9 % (4428 of 29,713 samples tested). Distribution of results by birth year cohort and specimen type suggested general consistency in mean, median and peak values but higher positivity rates in individuals born from 1964 to 1974. Female patients had a significantly lower positivity rate (P < 0.0001), although similar load mean and median values, compared to males. Overall, 15.3 % (676 of 4428 positive results) of positive results had viral loads greater than 8 log10 copies/mL, with occasional samples exceeding 10 log10 copies/mL. These results support quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patient testing and efforts to control viral transmission."
"SARS-CoV-2 Transmission from Presymptomatic Meeting Attendee, Germany.","During a meeting in Munich, Germany, a presymptomatic attendee with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected at least 11 of 13 other participants. Although 5 participants had no or mild symptoms, 6 had typical coronavirus disease, without dyspnea. Our findings suggest hand shaking and face-to-face contact as possible modes of transmission."
"Undocumented Migrants Reintroducing COVID-19, Yunnan Province, China.","To limit the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the government of China has been monitoring infected travelers and minimizing cold-chain contamination. However, other factors might contribute to recurring outbreaks. We analyze the role of undocumented migrants as potential transmitters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in China."
"Animals, vaccines, and COVID-19.","Animals, especially mammals, have played a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 virus originated in animals, and the virus can jump back and forth between humans and animals. Moreover, animals have been central to the development of the various vaccines against the virus now employed around the world, continuing a long history. The interrelationships between animals and humans in both disease transmission and its prevention call for an interdisciplinary approach to medicine."
Integrated control of COVID-19 in resource-poor countries.,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges in controlling COVID-19. Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic."
Viral load dynamics in intubated patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit.,"Background: Prolonged viral RNA detection in respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 has been described, but the clinical relevance remains unclear. We studied the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a group and individual level in intubated ICU patients. Methods: In a cohort of 86 patients, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples (obtained as part of clinical care twice a week) according to time after intubation. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses. Results: 870 samples were tested by RT-PCR. Overall viral load was highest in the first week (median nasopharynx 3.5, IQR 1.5-4.3; median sputum 4.3, IQR 3.3-5.6) and decreased over time. In 20% of patients a relapsing pattern was observed. Nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR status on day 14 was not significantly associated with survival up to day 60 in this small cohort. Conclusion: In general SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in respiratory samples in patients with severe COVID-19 decrease after the first week after intubation, but individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels can show a relapsing pattern. Larger studies are needed to address the association of clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with survival, because we observed a trend towards better survival in patients with early clearance from sputum."
Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and potential intervention approaches.,"The major variant of concerns (VOCs) have shared mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins, mostly on the S1 unit and resulted in higher transmissibility rate and affect viral virulence and clinical outcome. The spike protein mutations and other non-structural protein mutations in the VOCs may lead to escape approved vaccinations in certain extend. We will discuss these VOC mutations and discuss the need for combination therapeutic strategies targeting viral cycle and immune host responses."
Laboratory diagnosis of emerging human coronavirus infections - the state of the art.,"The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at the beginning of the twenty-first century have highlighted the necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients."
Quantitative evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation using a deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode.,"Inactivation technology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is certainly a critical measure to mitigate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) would be a promising candidate to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, based on the well-known antiviral effects of DUV on microorganisms and viruses. However, due to variations in the inactivation effects across different viruses, quantitative evaluations of the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 by DUV-LED irradiation need to be performed. In the present study, we quantify the irradiation dose of DUV-LED necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we determined the culture media suitable for the irradiation of SARS-CoV-2 and optimized the irradiation apparatus using commercially available DUV-LEDs that operate at a center wavelength of 265, 280, or 300 nm. Under these conditions, we successfully analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and the irradiation dose of the DUV-LEDs at each wavelength without irrelevant biological effects. In conclusion, total doses of 1.8 mJ/cm2 for 265 nm, 3.0 mJ/cm2 for 280 nm, and 23 mJ/cm2 for 300 nm are required to inactivate 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide quantitative antiviral effects of DUV irradiation on SARS-CoV-2, serving as basic knowledge of inactivation technologies against SARS-CoV-2."
Screening for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR: Saliva or nasopharyngeal swab? Rapid review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients and screening of populations for SARS-CoV-2 infection require access to straightforward, low-cost and high-throughput testing. The recommended nasopharyngeal swab tests are limited by the need of trained professionals and specific consumables and this procedure is poorly accepted as a screening method In contrast, saliva sampling can be self-administered. Methods: In order to compare saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we designed a meta-analysis searching in PubMed up to December 29th, 2020 with the key words ""(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR COVID19) AND (salivary OR saliva OR oral fluid)) NOT (review[Publication Type]) NOT (PrePrint[Publication Type])"" applying the following criteria: records published in peer reviewed scientific journals, in English, with at least 15 nasopharyngeal/orapharyngeal swabs and saliva paired samples tested by RT-PCR, studies with available raw data including numbers of positive and negative tests with the two sampling methods. For all studies, concordance and sensitivity were calculated and then pooled in a random-effects model. Findings: A total of 377 studies were retrieved, of which 50 were eligible, reporting on 16,473 pairs of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal and saliva samples. Meta-analysis showed high concordance, 92.5% (95%CI: 89.5-94.7), across studies and pooled sensitivities of 86.5% (95%CI: 83.4-89.1) and 92.0% (95%CI: 89.1-94.2) from saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs respectively. Heterogeneity across studies was 72.0% for saliva and 85.0% for nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Our meta-analysis strongly suggests that saliva could be used for frequent testing of COVID-19 patients and ""en masse"" screening of populations."
"SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection models: Ethics, challenge agent production and regulatory issues.","This second International Alliance for Biological Standardization COVID-19 webinar brought together a broad range of international stakeholders, including academia, regulators, funders and industry, with a considerable participation from low- and middle-income countries, to discuss the use of controlled human infection models to accelerate development and market authorization assessment of a vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
"Origin, phylogeny, variability and epitope conservation of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses innumerous challenges, like understanding what triggered the emergence of this new human virus, how this RNA virus is evolving or how the variability of viral genome may impact the primary structure of proteins that are targets for vaccine. We analyzed 19471 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available at the GISAID database from all over the world and 3335 genomes of other Coronoviridae family members available at GenBank, collecting SARS-CoV-2 high-quality genomes and distinct Coronoviridae family genomes. Additionally, we analyzed 199,984 spike glycoprotein sequences. Here, we identify a SARS-CoV-2 emerging cluster containing 13 closely related genomes isolated from bat and pangolin that showed evidence of recombination, which may have contributed to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. The analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes presented 9632 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) corresponding to a variant density of 0.3 over the genome, and a clear geographic distribution. SNVs are unevenly distributed throughout the genome and hotspots for mutations were found for the spike gene and ORF 1ab. We describe a set of predicted spike protein epitopes whose variability is negligible. Additionally, all predicted epitopes for the structural E, M and N proteins are highly conserved. The amino acid changes present in the spike glycoprotein of variables of concern (VOCs) comprise between 3.4% and 20.7% of the predicted epitopes of this protein. These results favors the continuous efficacy of the available vaccines targeting the spike protein, and other structural proteins. Multiple epitopes vaccines should sustain vaccine efficacy since at least some of the epitopes present in variability regions of VOCs are conserved and thus recognizable by antibodies."
The role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 peptides in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.,"Since the end of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) posed a serious threat to human health and life. Therefore, the discovery of drugs that can effectively prevent and treat COVID-19 is urgently warranted. In this article, the role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in drug development and the treatment of COVID-19 are discussed. It was found that the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2-RBD involved two core regions (31st and 353rd lysine) and 20 amino acids of the ACE2 protein. The mutation of these amino acids could lead to a great change of the binding ability of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD. This information was important for us to find more efficient ACE2 peptides to block the 2019-nCoV infection. So during this study, we summarized the role of ACE2 in the regulation of 2019-nCoV infection and stress, and hypothesized that the development and optimization of ACE2 peptide can effectively block 2019-nCoV infection and reliably treat the COVID-19."
Aspirin Is Related to Worse Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19.,"Backgroundand Objectives: Aspirin is used globally to reduce pain and inflammation; however, its effect in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not fully investigated and remains controversial. We evaluated the association between aspirin and COVID-19 outcomes using nationwide data from the Korean National Health Insurance System. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study that included 22,660 eligible patients who underwent COVID-19 testing in South Korea between 1 January-31 July 2020. We identified all aspirin users prescribed aspirin within two weeks before or after the index date. The primary outcome was positivity for the COVID-19 test, and secondary outcomes included conventional oxygen therapy, intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. We applied the propensity score matching method to reduce the possible bias originating from the differences in patients' baseline characteristics. Results: Of those eligible, 662 patients were prescribed aspirin. Among them, 136 patients were on aspirin within two weeks before diagnosis and 526 patients were on aspirin after diagnosis. The COVID-19 test positivity rate was not significantly different according to aspirin use. Aspirin use before COVID-19 was related to an increased death rate and aspirin use after COVID-19 was related to a higher risk of the conventional oxygen therapy. Conclusion: Aspirin use was associated with adverse effects in COVID-19 patients. Further studies for mechanisms are needed."
Racial differences in anticipated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among religious populations in the US.,"Given high COVID-19 infection and mortality ratesamong racial minorities in the US and their higher rates of religiosity, it is important to examine how the intersection of race and religion influences perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations.Data for this study come from online surveys conducted in twelve congregations between October and December 2020 (N = 1,609). Based on logistic regression analyses, this study demonstrates a severe disparity of 24 percentage points (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.33) in anticipated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance between African Americans and White Americans, even when controlling for trust in COVID-19 information from scientists and levels of worrying about COVID-19 as well as religiosity and demographic factors. Religiosity is negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across racial groups. The findings suggest that the intersection of race and religion should be considered when designing immunization programs, for instance by fostering collaborations and dialogue with faith leaders of racial minority congregations."
Comparison of four new commercial serologic assays for determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG.,"Background: Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals with past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study design: Our study is the first to compare four new commercially available assays using 75 sera from patients tested positive or negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR: the anti SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun, Germany), the EDI New Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA, (Epitope diagnostics (EDI), USA), the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Germany), and the SARS-CoV-2 Virachip IgG (Viramed, Germany). Results: We found a sensitivity of 86.4 %, 100 %, 86.4 %, and 77.3 % and a specificity of 96,2 %, 88,7 %, 100 %, and 100 % for the Euroimmun assay, the EDI assay, the Mikrogen assay, and the Viramed assay, respectively. Conclusions: Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays have a sufficient specificity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Diagnostic Performance of Ag-RDTs and NAAT for SARS-CoV2 Identification in Symptomatic Patients in Catalonia.,"The use of rapid antigenic tests (Ag-RDTs) to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a common practice recently. This study aimed to evaluate performance of Abbott PanbioTM Ag-RDTs with regard to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in the early stages of the disease. A cohort of 149,026 infected symptomatic patients, reported in Catalonia from November 2020 to January 2021, was selected. The positivity rates of the two tests were compared with respect to the dates of symptom onset. Ag-RDTs presented positivity rates of 84% in the transmission phases of the disease and 31% in the pre-symptomatic period, compared to 93% and 91%, respectively, for NAAT. The detection of many false negatives with Ag-RDTs during the pre-symptomatic period demonstrates the risk of virus dissemination with this diagnostic technique if used outside the symptomatic period."
Persistence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosol and on the surfaces.,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created havoc worldwide ever since its emergen-ce in December 2019. The current evidence indicates that the virus remains viable in aerosols for hours and on fomites for few days. A little information is available on the topic, the present communication reviews the perseverance and distribution of the novel coronavirus in the aerosol and on various inanimate surfaces so that the appropriate safety measures can be undertaken and the virus protection guidelines may be framed accordingly."
Persistent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in asymptomatic healthcare worker: infective virion or inactive nucleic acid?,"Asymptomatic individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA constitute a significant proportion of the infected population and play a role in the transmission of the virus. We describe a healthcare worker who presented with fever and malaise and was diagnosed with mild COVID-19. The symptoms resolved within 4 days but there was persistent positivity of viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract for more than 58 days, which is the longest reported duration of persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare worker. In this case report, we discuss clinical and administrative issues such as the role of asymptomatic cases in the transmission of the virus to patients and coworkers as an occupational hazard, interpretation of persistent positivity of nucleic acid test, duration of isolation and return-to-work guidelines pertinent to researchers and global health policymakers."
[Societal impact of vaccination : beyond individual protection. Renewed interest following COVID-19 pandemic ?].,"Vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and hampering efforts to control vaccine-preventable diseases. Healthcare professionals have a critical role in the acceptance of vaccination by patients. Increased awareness about the benefits of vaccination is one of the recommended strategy to counter vaccine hesitancy. Beyond protection of individuals against specific pathogens, vaccination have broad benefits at multiple levels of society, partly mediated by community protection. These benefits include improved access to education, increased productivity and positive fiscal impact, limitation of gender inequalities, control and prevention of antibiotic resistant pathogens. In this narrative review, those benefits are summarized and relevant studies reviewed. The broad benefits of immunization should contribute to better communication about the impact of immunization and could be part of educational programs of future health-care workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has a tremendous socio-economic impact and is the illustration of a world without vaccine. Nevertheless, recent surveys indicate that the acceptance of a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will not be universal, illustrating the importance of communication centered on safety and tolerability of future vaccines."
COVID-19 Vaccination-Related Uptake on FDG PET/CT: An Emerging Dilemma and Suggestions for Management.,"As mass COVID-19 vaccination is underway, radiologists are encountering transient FDG uptake in normal or enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination. This phenomenon may confound interpretation in patients with cancer undergoing FDG PET/CT. In this article, we present our institutional approach for management of COVID-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy on FDG PET/CT according to early experience. We suggest performing PET/CT at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination but optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for postvaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer. Our preliminary experience and suggested institutional approach should guide radiologists in management of patients with cancer undergoing PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination."
Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and its determinants among Lebanese dentists: a cross-sectional study.,"Background: Dentists are at high risk of exposure to occupational Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since vaccination is crucial to control COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and its determinants among Lebanese practicing dentists. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted between February 15 and 22, 2021, among dentists practicing in Lebanon. Prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was estimated. A multivariable modified Poisson regression model was used to explore determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Results: In total, 86% of participants were willing to receive or have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. Having received the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to a 12% increase in the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate. In addition, participants having moderate and high COVID-19 vaccination knowledge levels were more likely to accept receiving the vaccine, and participants whose fear of COVID-19 level was high were more likely to accept receiving the vaccine compared to those having a low fear level. Contrarily, those who visit the medical doctor only when needed and once a year were less likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine compared to participants who routinely visit the medical doctor. Conclusions: Our study showed a high level of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among Lebanese practicing dentists. And since knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination was associated with the vaccine acceptance, it should be improved and updated to further increase the acceptance rate. High acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among dentists is expected to have a positive impact among the population in terms of increasing awareness and vaccine uptake."
"COVID-19: Current understanding of its Pathophysiology, Clinical presentation and Treatment.","Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 is a novel coronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae and is now known to be responsible for the outbreak of a series of recent acute atypical respiratory infections originating in Wuhan, China. The disease caused by this virus, termed coronavirus disease 19 or simply COVID-19, has rapidly spread throughout the world at an alarming pace and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. In this review, an update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and the most recent management strategies for COVID-19 has been described. Materials and methods: A search was conducted for literature and various articles/case reports from 1997 to 2020 in PUBMED/MEDLINE for the keywords coronavirus, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and mRNA virus. Results and conclusions: COVID-19 has now spread globally with increasing morbidity and mortality among all populations. In the absence of a proper and effective antibody test, the diagnosis is presently based on a reverse-transcription PCR of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples. The clinical spectrum of the disease presents in the form of a mild, moderate or severe illness. Most patients are either asymptomatic carriers who despite being without symptoms have the potential to be infectious to others coming in close contact, or have a mild influenza-like illness which cannot be differentiated from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Moderate and severe cases require hospitalisation as well as intensive therapy which includes non-invasive as well as invasive ventilation, along with antipyretics, antivirals, antibiotics and steroids. Complicated cases may require treatment by immunomodulatory drugs and plasma exchange therapy. The search for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is presently in full swing, with pharmaceutical corporations having started human trials in many countries."
Identification of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathways reveals drug repurposing strategies.,"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates the rapid development of new therapies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Here, we present the identification of 200 approved drugs, appropriate for repurposing against COVID-19. We constructed a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein network, based on disease signatures defined by COVID-19 multiomics datasets, and cross-examined these pathways against approved drugs. This analysis identified 200 drugs predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-induced pathways, 40 of which are already in COVID-19 clinical trials, testifying to the validity of the approach. Using artificial neural network analysis, we classified these 200 drugs into nine distinct pathways, within two overarching mechanisms of action (MoAs): viral replication (126) and immune response (74). Two drugs (proguanil and sulfasalazine) implicated in viral replication were shown to inhibit replication in cell assays. This unbiased and validated analysis opens new avenues for the rapid repurposing of approved drugs into clinical trials."
